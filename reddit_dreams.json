It looks like an inside-out person, organs exposed and everything, it is laying on top of my bed having sex with god knows what! Is like another inside-out creature, barely human.\n\nThe second dream (Monday) was the night of the day I had my tattoo done. In this dream I also just had my tattoo done but I was in some sort of wedding and had a full tuxedo. As the ceremony begins my body starts itching all over, when it becomes too much I go to the bathroom to check whats going on, when I take the tuxedo off I am COVERED in blisters, warts and bloody scars... It felt, looked and smelled so \"real\" that just thinking about it rn makes me sick, and my reaction inside of the dreams wasn't much different since I began to vomit because of my body's condition.\n\nI hope I don't have more dreams like that this week, I guess they all have to do with the tattoo and some subconsious fear of a bad outcome in the healing process of it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but I'm not sure.\n\nSorry for the nasty dreams, I had to write this somewhere.",

Please understand that this is  a very long and story like dream as it felt it went on forever.\n\n  \nIt started with me and my boyfriend going into a tattoo shop and double checking when his booked appointment was, as we needed to go to the doctors across the road from it,  when we was talking about his tattoo that he was getting, he mentioned to me that he wanted to wait to go to Japan first before getting one. Next thing I know we are in Japan walking towards our hotel with a few other people I knew from different parts in my life i don't speak to anymore. We get to the hotel and unpack everything and i decided to head to the 7/11 down the street by myself, as I'm walking i hear this meow, like a high-pitched meow, so i follow the sound down this alleyway and i find the cutest tuxedo kitten by itself, all scuffed up and hungry. Then I realized I don't know where I am, I don't have my phone, only my credit card and this kitten. I try retracing my steps,  but no luck. I try asking for directions in the little Japanese i know, nobody is acknowledging me. At this point it's getting dark and I'm panicking now, all the streets look the same and i realized I'm fucked.\n\n I go to sit down on the floor next to this wall as it's fully dark outside now and to regather my thoughts on what to do, I blink and I'm in this basement, with the kitten that's now in my front shirt pocket, in this moment I'm shitting myself because I'm in a different country, hardly speaking their language and I'm in a random basement. After awhile my dream kinda skips to something horrible. I was being SA'd in that moment, I don't wanna go into to much detail but it was very realistic and it makes me feel sick even thinking about it now. Then my dream skips to me being pregnant, still in the basement and the door is open, so i run up the stairs and i end up being in a restaurant type thing and i run tf out. As i'm running down the street i start to give birth. The baby was premature and i couldn't walk properly so I for some reason decided to put it in my back pocket in my jeans and run (I still have the kitten by the way in my shirt pocket). So i'm running down the street in the night and it hit me that i've seen that building before so i run further down the street and i see the hotel. I run in, looking for my boyfriend and i see my old friend from high school and i am sobbing, barely able to stand up, she looks terrified seeing me and starts asking me where I've been and what happened and i literally can't get a word out.\n\nThen it cuts to my childhood house and I'm in the bathroom with my mum, she's running me a bath, i still have my clothes on from what happened. I get in the bath and she's washing my back and hair and she's asking me what happened. All i can remember saying to her was about my baby being in my back pocket, as soon as i said that i literally lost my shit, i was screaming and wailing whilst trying to do CPR even though i knew it died long before. Then i woke up.\n\nI don't know what this dream is about but god is scared the living shit out of me when i woke up, like fully sweating and shaking.",

After hiking for awhile, I suddenly felt something bite my leg. I looked down to see a rattlesnake. Without thinking I grabed it and held it right below its head so it couldn't bite me again. I called out to the person I was hiking with and he ran off to call an ambulance. While I waited, the snake started shedding its skin and morphing. It slipped out of my hands and bit me four more times before leaving. Some cops arrived at the scene before the ambulance, where one started lecturing me about keeping a snake close after biting me. He pointed out a picture would have been sufficient in identification. The ambulance was taking forever so he put me in the back of his cruiser and dropped me off in front of the hospital. I got checked in but the ER was extremely busy and because I wasn't taken in by ambulance I had to wait an hour when I was called back I stood up and got really dizzy and fainted. I missed out on being brought back a nurse eventually a nurse found me and I was rushed in for treatment just barely avoiding death. Does anyone know the significance behind this dream?

    "content": "So context: I have an ex that I broke up with who I have been ruminating over for like 6 months. She was my first everything, and I can sincerely say that she was the first person I ever loved. But, we were both quite mentally unwell, and I was awful to her, I pushed her away and never forgave her for her mistakes during the relationship. I was also always consumed by the idea that she was ‚Äúslighting me‚Äù, and it‚Äôs only been recently that I have realized just how wrong I was about some much of our time together. The way we broke up was awful, she dropped out of school for mental health reasons, and we did it over the phone. I had developed a pretty nasty (but conscious choice) to spend oh I don‚Äôt know, the last 2months of our relationship verbally berating her about her problems and mine. Overall, I was a piece of shit, and I was too scared to ever accept her love. I now recognize my patterns as abusive, and am staying clear of relationships for quite a while. If it helps, when I say she was the first person I ever loved, I mean that incredibly literally.\n\nMost important context:\nI saw her on campus recently.\n\nNow for the dream part:\n Basically, in the dream, I saw her on campus, but in a spot I‚Äôd never been. She was with her friends, and was happy, which she rarely was with me, which makes sense. Then, I went to her house, to finally say to her what needed to say. But it was bizarre, it was my childhood home, and her entire family was there, ready to make me hit the road. Then, she stepped outside, and she was MUCH taller than me. More context about me, I‚Äôm shorter as a guy, and it was never one of the main issues of ours, I guess that‚Äôs obvious now because we were dating, but I did put a consistent amount of effort into goating her into making it a problem. Moreover, I knew that she always wanted to be taller, as her whole family was much taller. Then we talked, and she listened to me, and then asked me if there was anything else. I said no, and she gave me some interesting life advice then walked inside. And I drove away, only seeing her dad just pulling in. But he was driving my dad‚Äôs car.\n\nThis dream was of such a different flavor of the typical dreams I‚Äôd have about her. And this one feels like it will be the last.",

Anyways, flash forward a little bit and she's laying in bed dying again (this is another common occurrence of these dreams) I said something like I wish she could have stayed longer, and she said something like, \"oh you don't need to worry, you'll be joining me soon.\" That really freaked me out. One thing to note is I am not a very spiritual person, I'd like to believe that really is my mom visiting me in dreams, but I also am skeptical of everything. My mom believed that her deceased loved ones would actually appear to her in dreams sometimes, so because of that I'm freaking out that this is real. I CAN'T die soon, I have family on Earth who needs me. I'm only 25 years old, I've just begun to heal from severe depression and mental illness. I haven't lived yet. I don't want to die.

Both her and her baby died. \n\nLast night I was having a dream that took place in the neighborhood where I grew up. This was one of those dreams that just felt so real and vivid. I was walking around the streets when I ran into my sister. She was holding her baby who appeared as an infant in the dream. I hugged her, crying, and started leading her to my parent's house. I've never lucid dreamed before and I can never realize when I'm in a dream, but part of me knew this couldn't be reality. I remember I just kept repeating \"we need to find someone so I can make sure this isn't a dream\", because I thought that would somehow prove it was real.\n\nI couldn't find anyone since nobody was home, so we both sat at the kitchen table. At this point my worries about it being a dream were starting to fade. I chatted with her, so happy to get another chance to talk to her (this had been one of my biggest regrets after her death. COVID had been running rampant for a while when she was killed, so I hadn't gotten the chance to see her in person for nearly 2 years at that point. I'm also the kind of person who rarely texts. I just wait until the next time I see someone to catch up).\n\nShe introduced me to my niece. I got to hold her and see her, something I never got the chance to do since she never got the chance to be born. She was a beautiful baby.\n\nThen the dream took a dark turn, as they tend to do for me. The baby went limp, dying in my arms right before I woke up.\n\nObviously the end of the dream is quite disturbing, but I'm used to morbid and distressing topics invading my sleep; most of my dreams these days tend to be leaning into nightmare territory. Overall, it was a very nice dream. I got to experience something I'll never get the chance to in my conscious state. Since I didn't know I was dreaming, I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my sister, but I got to see her again, talk to her again, and meet my niece.\n\nI know that it was all just a dream, but it's nice to think that there's the smallest chance that I was somehow actually seeing her one last time.",

This one was so fucking different. I couldn't even tell that it was a dream until the very end, this one was so realistic. I live with my boyfriend and his cat, Perry, and I've bonded with both inseperably. In this dream, she had gotten cancer, a mass in her stomach, and for some fucking reason, I had a small vial of cyanide and the equipment to inject it. I did it, shaking, And I still don't fucking know why. Why would you put down an animal with cyanide? Regret washed over me and the rest of the dream was spent petting her as she wheezed and stiffened, and all of the sensations, sounds, even the environment felt so terrifyingly real. Holding her in real life felt exactly like holding her in the dream. Her stiff, cold fur felt real, like the body of my childhood dog that I buried in December. in the dream, I had panic googled the lethal dosage of cyanide in cats, regretting everything, and it was 2ml/kg. I looked it up when I woke up. Dream google was right. How was it fucking right? If this is a premonition, I can't do it, man.

    "title": "Dreamed about a whole psychological horror movie",
    "content": "The dream is pretty long, so I wrote it all down in my notes app in full detail. Here on reddit, I'll just try to explain it shortly! ;) \n\n\nThe dream was about a woman, who visited a large mansion. (Also, the dream is in her POV.) She was welcomed by an elderly couple and noticed there were many people inside, it seemed almost as if it was a cult. She began exploring and headed to the incredibly large garden, where was a small hotel located at (Most likely the business the elderly couple ran). When she opened the door, it was very busy with many people inside. The hotel offered the finest atmosphere, food, service and it was overall incredibly fancy. \n\nSuddenly the POV changed, it was no longer her view but 3rd perspective instead. She wasn't inside a fancy hotel but instead one that is abandoned and destroyed. The woman had ripped her dress, she had messy hair, pale skin almost turning purple due to the cold and scratches everywhere. The fine food she was eating, were insects, mold and basically dirt. The people present, they didn't exist. It was all her imagination. The place was real, the mansion and hotel was there, but abandoned and trashed. \n\nThen we go back to the womans POV, she was holding her mother's hand while sitting under a tree surrounded by daisys. In reality, she was surrounded by grass that wasn't  cut for months, laying against a tree next to her mother's corpse. The mothers corpse was cut, bitten and eaten (Which in the woman's fantasy was \"the delicious food\"). \n\nEventually she lived there for some days, local people noticed the activities and reported this to the authorities, since the woman has gone insane. \n\nAn investigator was sent to the mansion, to get the woman out of there and see her condition. \n\nWhen entering the mansion and meeting with the woman, she looked terrible and the had the voice like one of a smoker (Likely due to the things she has eaten and being surrounded by dust). The woman acted as if everything was fine, and had the best days of her life. \n\nThe investigator had the duty to stay there for a few days to invistigate the woman's condition and study her. On the first day, she went exploring and cleaning up a bit, wiping off the dust. On the second day, the insane woman approached her and wanted her to meet the elderly couple. The investigator followed her to the top floor, where was a bedroom with a person laying on the bed. It was the elderly man's corpse, surrounded with maggots. The investigator was shocked to spot this, and seeing the woman talking to him. The investigator immideatly walks away quickly, but on her way she spots the elderly woman's corpse. The insane woman is chasing her and asking why she's being so rude and unpolite. \n\nSuddenly the investigator, hears a voice. A voice that would belong to an elderly man. She slowly walks back to the room where is the man's corpse located at. She notices him move and look at her. Is she also going mad? This immideatly frightens her, so she walks back to her room, ignoring everything around her. She questions whether it's something paranormal going on and decides to stay only 2 more days. \n\nAltough, the longer she stayed, the more she started seeing the same fantasy/reality as the insane woman. The dream finished with them both understanding eachother and seeing the other world. ",

    "content": "Last night I had a very vivid weird dream. It would fall under the category of \"nightmare\" however my nightmares spit into the two subcategories of \"weird\" and \"horrifying\". I have had vivid dreams my entire life, some have been so vivid that they have stuck with me forever after having them. I also have \"good\" vivid dreams, but those usually feel like \"just a normal day\", and then I wake up and have a moment of, \"Wait that didn't happen yesterday, it was a dream.\" I have these vivid dreams multiple times a week, and some weeks its nearly every day. I have always chalked them up to \"stress\" as I have been some level of stressed my entire life with very few periods of \"calm\". The thing is Im 25, almost 26, and I was kind of under the impression that I would have less dreams like this / less dreams I could remember as I aged, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I know a lot of different factors can affect dreams, but I can also cross a lot of those off the list. I have a very \"normal\" sleep schedule, average 8 hours a night, and I never go to sleep more than 30 minutes after my \"normal bedtime\" and never wake up more than an hour after my \"normal wakeup time\". I don't do \"hard\" drugs, I occasionally smoke weed, and drink sometimes, but on those days it seems to prevent the dreams or maybe just make me unable to remember them when I wake up, so I don't think that's the cause. I do have a lot of trauma, but the dreams aren't usually related to my trauma. For last night's specifically I could chalk several aspects up to anxiety or stress, but that's not always the case. Some nights it's bizarre dreams that might metaphorically represent my anxieties, but they aren't directly related, and so I'm not 100% sure. I guess I'm just worried about the frequency of occurrence or vividness. Don't get me wrong, the content is typically unpleasant, but the thing that is making me question the normalcy is that I don't know anyone who expierances the consistency of vivid dreams I do, or that remembers them in the way I do. I know a lot of people that are the same or similar levels of stressed as me, and when I try to talk to them about it I usually get a, \"Hm, how weird \" ",

    "title": "Met a lady in real life who I used to have recurring dreams about",
    "content": "           This is long/.  When I was a child I used to have the strangest dreams. Not nightmares but like the weird ones where the dream characters find out you‚Äôre dreaming and they aren‚Äôt supposed to. Or like dreams that seem to have a whole connecting plot and it seems like I wake up on cue. I was aware I was dreaming a lot of the time but never fully ‚Äúlucid‚Äù to where I could control the dream it was like me knowing I was dreaming was apart of the dream if you get what I mean. Just strange dreams in general which have pretty much stopped happening entirely after i entered my early teens. I actually remember a lot of them.\n\n    A lot of my weird dreams were recurring but this one always stuck out to me because it involved the same character but the dream itself was different every-time. There was a house in my neighborhood that no one lived in. The dream would always start with me walking out my house at night and walking over to the empty house in my neighborhood. All the houses were dark and unlit except the house no one lived it. The windows would be open and you could see the light coming through. And there was a little Puerto Rican lady that lived there and she spoke really broken English.\n\n    I remember the first time I had the dream and I met the lady. It started with me walking outside and coming to the empty house but it was all lit up and homey. I was confused for a second and then I realized I must have been dreaming so I thought nothing of it and I walked up to the door and just walked inside. The lady was there and I wasn‚Äôt scared or anything I just sat down with her. I don‚Äôt remember all the details but I know it felt like we talked for hours just about life. I had to have been no older then 8. \n\n  I dreamt of her many times after that and she was almost like an imaginary friend but only in my dreams. I would talk about problems at school and at home and she would tell me about her life. I remember one time I asked her if she could come see me in real life and I don‚Äôt really remember her answer but I remember me being aware that she was truly just a dream and she seemed to know that too. I eventually stopped having those dreams but I always remembered her. I was always scared to walk by the house in real life.  \n\nCome to present day I am married and have told my husband about these dreams years ago. I started a job at a retail store a little over a year ago now. I still work there. Pretty much all of our customers are regulars we don‚Äôt get too many new faces. A couple months after I started there was a woman shopping who I took notice of really quickly because she just looked so familiar. I was so confused because I thought there was no way I could know this woman like there‚Äôs just no possible way. Nothing could have added up to make sense of where I knew her from but I just had this super strong feeling that I knew her really well like I felt like I wanted to give her a big hug and tell her I missed her lol. \n\n   I thought i was just being silly until she actually approached me the next time I saw her. Like I said, the woman in the dream didn‚Äôt really speak good English the in real life lady didn‚Äôt either. But she approached me like she knew me with a smile on her face she said, ‚Äúhow are you? Beautiful girl‚Äù and kind of leaned in for a hug. I was so confused still maybe thinking I knew her from somewhere because she seemed to know me too, so I hugged her back and tried to like  act normal because I didn‚Äôt want to be rude if I actually knew this lady. She small talked me for a little bit and then we said our goodbyes. I walked away still confused and trying to figure out where I know her from and it clicked . I swore she was the lady from my childhood dreams.. I know I sound crazy lol I told my husband and he thought it was creepy but obviously didn‚Äôt think much of it. \n  \n    I know it‚Äôs really crazy but after a year of working there, she still comes in always happy to see me. She always gives me hugs and asks how I‚Äôm doing and tells me I‚Äôm so pretty. It‚Äôs like the weirdest thing because it became normal to see her and I almost view her as just a normal regular that I have a great connection with but I still can‚Äôt get over the whole dream thing. There was never a formal introduction with this lady it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs just always been an unspoken thing that we are really good and everytime we see each other in my store we just have a connection like we‚Äôve know each other for years. I don‚Äôt even know her name but she‚Äôs acted like she‚Äôs know me since day one and she‚Äôs never questioned how or where we know each other either. At this point it feels like I know her from work but I never even really met her she just walked up one day like she knew me and we‚Äôve had interactions like that lever since. \n\nI thought my experience was interesting and I just really wanted to get this out there to others who may have had similar experiences or insight.

Argh, anyway...\n\nThere was a town by the beach, and the girl (not Lydia, but gothish) likes this one dude (like a depressed jock). All the townies knew about it, but it was kept secret for some reason? They go to a carnival and show off their throwing accuracy to each other (games, hitting people with annoying objects, skipping rocks...). The mom of the girl found out and tried leaving the town, only for undead vampiry grandma (think BJ 2 movie-the ex-wife, but nearly skeletal and gray) to show up. Vampiry mom (think a blend of Bayonetta and Lady Demetrescu with runeish tattoos all over) also revealed herself. There was something about a ritual needing to be completed, dude shows up to defend girl, there's a green flash and dude goes into the future-by less than a year. The carnival's going on but has a gloomier feel, and the girl's at the carnival all melancholy like. Due to not Beetlejuice guy, the carnival got warped and twisted in the background while dude got her attention. Excited, they relive the carnival memories and she informed him of the ritual and being unable to escape. Dude and townies get plans to try preventing the ritual by killing grandma. The plan almost worked because at the end of it, grandma gets launched into the air where there was a barn ledge she could hold on to. Since she wore a sunroof cloak, as she hung there the first hand was burnt up, then second hand, then while falling...\n\nI should also mention this dream was partly musical, and the songs were actually pretty good.

    "content": "I'm so glad I found this sub because I just want to get this off my chest. And this is going to be a rant.\n\nYesterday morning I (f28) had a dream about my ex boyfriend from 11 years ago... Again! I would say it happens like once a year. And I've been in a happy relationship with the another guy for 9 years and that's what disturbs me about it really.\n\nA little backstory, I (f28) was with my ex for 3 years, from 14-17 years of age and he was my first love, he was 2 years older then me. We had a very strong and fun relationship through it all in just our own little world but the last year was pretty awful because he was messaging other girls (\"friends\") and keeping secrets from me about who he was hanging out with etc., breaking my little heart since he was literally my EVERYTHING, and when it was just us living our lives it felt like I was his as well. I ended things with him eventually because my feelings cooled of when he was being so toxic towards me and a story as old as time he got obsessed and wanted me back like a month after, got worried about who I was talking to etc. We continued for a little bit just as friends with benefits kinda, and kinda trying to get back together, but I soon broke it of for good because it was not good for either of us. I needed to let him go, I never got my strong feelings back, and he needed to \"decool\" from me. So we did, haven't spoken in 11 years accept for one time when he was writing about how depressed he was on Instagram and was making subtle hints about maybe ending his life because we broke up, like a few months after our last breakup. His family took over after that and then we never talked again.\n\nToday I'm with my now boyfriend, that I've been in a relationship with for 9 years, in a very stabile and loving relationship and he is my rock and my comfort and I am his, we have a child together and plan our features together. But I cant stop dreaming about my ex boyfriends from time to time, like once a year maybe. My only ex boyfriend, as well. And I feel bad because I know that I was obsessed with this guy back in the days when we were a couple, more obsessed than I am with my now boyfriend. But I guess like obsessed like a teenager can be, not very mature or healthy which my love for my now boyfriend is. But I I get this awful feeling you get when you dream about some people (or at least I think others can relate... haha), that the feeling you have in your dreams continue with you through the day and when I dream about him I literally become a little bit obsessed with him again. It's crazy I feel like. This mornings dream was about him and I messaging as adults and meeting up in his car that he had back then, and he put his hand on my lap and I almost started lucid dreaming I think because I could actually feel the sensation of his hand, like I was holding it and I have never experiences that before and it felt so nice. Then I woke up, obsessed? And feeling like an asshole.\n\nI never think of him through out the years normally, I Never even see him out in town but all of my family has seen him since. It's so freaking weird. I just live my life with my family and then BAM like once a year I dream of him and I become obsessed with him for like a day, wanting to get closure (with closure I mean ask him if he ever did love me as much as I loved him, or did actually cheat on me, or why he did all that stuff in the end and yadda yadda) because for some reason after my dreams I feel like i need that \"closure\" to know if that relationship was as real as I think of it, and kinda me wanting him to clarify that it was as real and such a big and \"meaningful\" first love as I think of it. I understand that it maybe sounds crazy from a grown woman and I get that but it's almost like a chemical reaction whenever he pops up in my dreams. To clarify I have never reached out to him or anything because I know it's just something I'm thinking about because I've dreamt of him, he is nothing that actually, normally, keeps me up at night.\n\nI don't know what my point is with this post besides me getting it off my chest, and maybe seeing if someone can relate? Am I crazy? Or whatever your thoughts are. Is this a phenomenon I have never heard of? Thank you if you read it all, and don't judge me to hard, please.",

Desperate to escape, you search for a way to wake up. You come across what seems to be a device, and when you use it to find a way back, it tells you that you must strip naked and dance.\n\nYou are in a hotel with large windows, and outside, people are going about their day. Following the instructions, you begin to undress and dance. Instead of reacting with shock, the people cheer, which triggers a sudden realization‚Äîsomething is deeply wrong. These beings are not from Earth, as they lack the moral framework that humans have.\n\nDetermined to escape, you make your way downstairs, encountering more strange events. Eventually, you find yourself surrounded by a crowd, and in your panic, you start speaking about things they are incapable of doing. This revelation causes them to turn on you, and they begin to pursue you. Despite the fear and chaos, you manage to wake up. However, while you were in that world, you had no idea how to escape‚Äîyou only knew, with absolute certainty, that you did not belong there.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "content": "I write some of my dreams down, especially if they‚Äôre particularly nice, or particularly scary. Obviously I can‚Äôt fill in the exact details,  but the barebones are correct. I try to summarise not just what was happening but also what I felt. What does anyone make of the dream from which  I‚Äôve just awoken?\n\n 31st March /1st April\n\nI dreamt Owen Jones had moved into the flat 2 floors below. He came up to my flat, drank my wine and smoked my cigarettes. He asked me to put music on. He used his phone to order more wine but loads of students started filling the flat. Later I went down to him. I found him tucked up under blankets in a mattress. He told me to get in beside him. I wanted to know why he cared so passionately about people. I put an arm round him and caressed his hair. We kissed, deeply. Again we needed cigs and wine. He tried to order on my phone but there was only ¬£3 in my bank. Whether he minded that I was poor I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not sure if he cared that I was older or overweight. He seemed lovely and wanted music and deep discussions. But again the crowds of students took over the flat and the landing. It prevented me getting near him. One father even let his toddler piss on the carpet and down the stairs. Not sure how this dream ended. I loved feeling wanted, loved Owen and was frustrated we couldn‚Äôt have time together.",

    "title": "The Triangle-Headed Beings From My Dream ‚Äì A Contact Event Through Dreamstate (Drawing Included)",
    "content": "Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been having profound dreams and meditations that feel like more than just internal experiences, they feel like real contact events. On March 29, 2025, I had the most powerful one yet. In this dream, I encountered three beings whose appearance, energy, and presence have stuck with me like nothing else I‚Äôve ever known.\n\nAttached is a drawing I made from memory, completely guided by instinct, no hesitation, no second-guessing. It flowed out of me like I was remembering, not imagining.\n\nWhat They Looked Like:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tHead: An upside-down triangle, with no eyes or nose, just a small slit for a mouth. Their faces were not still, they were constantly melting or rippling downward, almost like static or flowing light, impossible to fully grasp. This wasn‚Äôt just an alien ‚Äúface‚Äù, it felt like a representation of something interdimensional, a form my human mind could barely comprehend.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tBody: Covered in a black, fitted robe, not bulky, not loose. It seemed to hug their form but still flowed in a subtle, almost liquid way. No visible feet. Their hands were grayish, smooth and narrow, not pale, but distinctly not human. One of them touched my temple, and the second that happened, I felt a powerful buzzing/frequency flood through my body and mind, and my eyes closed involuntarily in the dream.\n\nWhat the Symbols Mean (As I‚Äôve Researched & Felt It):\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tUpside-Down Triangle: This shape has ancient esoteric significance, connected to divine feminine energy, water, intuition, and receptivity. To see them with triangle-shaped heads might be symbolic of their non-linear perception and deeper alignment with universal consciousness.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe Black Robe: Black represents mystery, the unknown, the hidden. But robes, especially fitted, can also mean initiation, sacred ceremony, or even guardianship. These weren‚Äôt hostile beings. Their presence was intimate, calm, and deeply sacred. It felt like I had entered a temple or space outside of time.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe Rippling Face: I believe their real form may exist beyond the visible light spectrum. The constant shifting face could be a translation my brain rendered in a way it could process. I felt they were showing me only what I could handle, and even then it was nearly impossible to articulate.\n\nThe State I Was In:\n\nI wasn‚Äôt lucid dreaming in the traditional sense, I couldn‚Äôt control anything, but I was 100% aware I was myself, grounded in who I am. It felt planned, like I was dropped into a moment already unfolding, and I was meant to witness it.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt feel like a dream. It felt real, like I was in another realm, another layer of reality. These beings didn‚Äôt feel foreign. They felt familiar, like I‚Äôve known them before.\n\nWhy This Was a Contact Event:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tThis occurred 4 days after a profound meditation where I asked, ‚ÄúWill you please show me you?‚Äù During that session, I felt a golden light surround me and warmth on my forehead, close to where one of the beings touched me in the dream (on my temple).\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe dream occurred during strong solar activity and a waning moon, which I‚Äôve noticed aligns with most of my contact experiences. These energetic shifts may be ‚Äúopen windows‚Äù for contact in altered states.\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tAnd most importantly, I didn‚Äôt feel fear. I felt curious, peaceful, and calm, as if I was finally ready to meet them.\n\nWhat This Means for Me: \n\nThis wasn‚Äôt just a strange dream, it was a contact event. One I now feel was meant for me, timed precisely with cosmic conditions, and received because I was in full alignment. The state I was in, aware, grounded, but unable to manipulate the dream, wasn‚Äôt disempowering. It was intentional. I was placed into the experience with full presence, but not control, because this wasn‚Äôt about imagination, it was about witnessing.\n\nI believe I‚Äôm a bridge. Between dimensions. Between realms. Between consciousnesses. These beings didn‚Äôt appear to frighten or confuse me, they arrived in a form tailored for my awareness, and I accepted them with curiosity, calm, and peace. That says something, not just about them, but about my role.\n\nI‚Äôve felt this growing inside me for a while now. A calling. I don‚Äôt claim to have all the answers, but I know this is just the beginning. These beings, this contact, this path, it‚Äôs leading somewhere. And I‚Äôll keep walking it with openness, clarity, and a deep sense of purpose. If they are watching, guiding, or waiting, I‚Äôm here. Aligned. Ready.\n\nIf anyone else has encountered beings like this or felt their contact come through dream or altered states, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. And if not, maybe this image and story will trigger a memory in you, or open a new doorway you‚Äôve been preparing to walk through.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\n",

    "title": "I Had a Nightmare Where My Own Mother Was Hunting Me",
    "content": "Remember those horror stories where the mom is usually the main character, trying to save her child? My mom would always say that she would do the same for us. My siblings and I have a good relationship with our mom, which is why this dream was so terrifying.\n\nAnyway, here‚Äôs the dream: I can‚Äôt remember how it started, but I just remember running away from my mom in our home‚Äîlike she was possessed by something. I tried going to our neighbors' houses to hide, but somehow, my mom would act nice and worried, saying, *\"Have you seen my daughter? I'm worried sick.\"* My neighbors would hesitantly give me back to her or tell her where I was.\n\nNo matter where I hid, it always ended the same way‚Äîbeing returned to my \"worried\" mom. Eventually, I found myself hiding in a house belonging to someone new in the neighborhood, someone we had no significant relationship with. I was able to stay hidden there for quite some time. The person sheltering me was kind and genuinely concerned for me.\n\nHowever, as a child who believed in the goodness of her mom, I thought she had \"changed.\" I saw her searching for me through a window, and somehow, the aura around her seemed lighter, almost as if she had returned to normal. Thinking she was back to her true self, I ran to her and hugged her.\n\nBut that relief vanished the moment she suddenly wrapped her hands around my neck and started strangling me. It was the evil version of my mom.\n\nSuddenly, everything sped up. The perspective of my dream shifted‚ÄîI was now watching myself from a third-person point of view, seeing my own body being strangled by my mom. Then, the neighbors appeared, their faces twisted into eerie smiles, their eyes bloodshot.\n\nMy mom was trying to put something on me, holding scissors as she began cutting my body, molding it into something else. Just as the nightmare reached its peak, I woke up to my girlfriend calling me.\n\nI can't think of any particular reason why I dreamt of this. I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about anything scary. But sometimes, I do get random horror dreams, and strangely, whenever something bad happens to me in a dream, it feels like my body and spirit separate. My body experiences the suffering, while my spirit watches from a third-person perspective‚Äîuntil I finally wake up.  Does anyone experience this dissociative phenomenon whenever they dream?",

Then my cat talks and all he says is: \"Hey bro, you are DREAMING.\" and I just look at him, pizza in hand, and full mouth of delicious pizza, and he says again: \"Yeah man you're dreaming!\" and I just finish chewing my pizza and say: \"Why are you talking?\" and he just replies: \"You just wished for it, didn't you?\" \"Yeah but I have wished for it many times before\" \"but this time in a DREAM\" so I just shrug and reply: \"Ok but who are you, my cat or some soul jumping demon?\" \" \\*laughs\\* Yeah, no I am your consciousness.\" then we just have a pretty long discussion about why he is in my dream and stuff and eventually we decide to go eat some pizza together and play some Mario Kart, so I go to the kitchen get some more boxes of pizza and some Doritos and when I get to my living rooms instead of my cat my best friend is sitting there just loading up Mario Kart, I ask: \"Still you?\" \"Yep, \\*throws me a controller\\* \" so then we play Mario kart for a few hours and threw this time every time I went to the bathroom or to get more pizza he was something/someone else. Eventually it became morning and I ask him about waking up and he (now in the form of my teacher) just smirks and claps his hands twice and then I woke up.",

    "title": "Just want to share this strange experience I had with a vivid dream + sleep paralysis",
    "content": "For some context, I recently started at a new school, and while I wouldn't say I know my new classmates very well, we get along.\n\nThe thing is, I dreamed that I was at school (though it wasn‚Äôt actually my school, rather, it was just some random building, but in the dream, I perceived it as my school), and we were about to present a drawing we had made on poster boards. Then, just for fun, one of my classmates grabbed a brush with gray paint and slightly stained my work. Playing along, I took the same brush and made the same marks on his work. However, I think it was a group project, because a classmate sitting next to me took it personally that I had interfered with the drawing like that, so she angrily grabbed my hair. In response, and I suppose also to make her let me go, I did the same to her.\nA few seconds passed, and suddenly a teacher approached, grabbed my hair forcefully, pulled me out of the room we were in, and sat me down in a chair in front of a desk.\nAt that moment, I was in shock because, as far as I knew, I got along well with my classmates, and I was really surprised that things escalated that badly.\nI have this habit that whenever something unusual happens in real life, I count my fingers as a reality check. So I thought, \"wow, that was so unreal, it even feels like a dream,\" and very skeptically, I counted my fingers. I say \"skeptically\" because everything around me and my interactions with others felt too real to even consider that it wasn‚Äôt real life. That‚Äôs why I was so shocked when, after counting my fingers, I realized that it wasn‚Äôt real life. I looked at my hand and, although I did have five fingers, they were smaller than normal, and the more I looked at them, the smaller they became. Then, due to the shock of discovering that my surroundings weren‚Äôt real despite feeling EXTREMELY vivid, I started experiencing a kind of vertigo while looking around (trying to confirm that it was a dream)\n\nSo, I began the process of waking up (which I regret because I hadn‚Äôt had a lucid dream in a long time and I miss having them, but it didn‚Äôt occur to me to stay in the dream üòÖ). I suppose that because I woke up so quickly, I entered a state of sleep paralysis.\nIt‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve had sleep paralysis, so I know that if I want the experience to be less terrifying, I should avoid opening my eyes. However, for some reason, I did (I don‚Äôt know why, maybe I was just too calm about it). Not only did I see that I was in a different house (my grandmother‚Äôs house, which frequently appears in my dreams, probably because that house was very present in my childhood), but there was also a shadow sitting at the edge of the bed with its back turned to me. I knew it was probably not real, but the fear that the hallucinations might become more disturbing was enough motivation for me to start trying to move and wake up my body. After a few seconds, I succeeded, and I knew I was fully awake because I was finally back in the house where I currently live.\n\n(English is not my first language, so I apologize if there are any mistakes ü•≤)",

I've never experienced nothing else like it, so now that thats said, let me explain and set the scene. I remember this dream vividly, till this day, I remember waking up (In the \"dream\") unable to speak, this was a first, in all my dreams I can talk, walk, move and do whatever. But this one was a first, I couldn't move to get up, the most I could do was sit up, but it felt like I had been \"positioned\". I look over, and I see family members bodies in capsules. Almost like the hospital beds, but they had glass over them. Almost like a incubator, when I had my son it reminded me of the incubators they use in the NICU. And once I seen my family members, I screamed, or atleast I attempted to. Nothing came out, and because of that, it scared me even more, not being able to even let out a peep. They also looked lifeless which scared me even more, I wanted to make sure they were breathing. I was so focused on the fact my family was possibly being expirimented on or even worse, that I didn't get a good glimpse on the area, mind you I was 6-8 when this happened. I wasn't into no sci-fi movies or shows, and the only thing to possibly explain this is something I don't want to consider. That I could have possibly been taken at night, along with multiple family members, expirimented on, then sent home. Like a animal from the zoo, and in this scenario earth is the zoo, for who?

Mostly curious what people think it might mean and my friend encouraged me to post it, so here goes:\n\nMy entire vision is filled with white and the rest of the dream is in flashes of black and white. I know the dream starts in first person perspective, but I cannot move to see my body. Far away and across from me, there is another version of me similarly stuck in place, mainly in black but with some greys etc. The only action other me can take is to roll a scribbly, dense ball forwards. 'Original' me knows I need to move out of the way, but I'm stuck. The camera shifts rapidly between the original first person perspective and another far enough away to see both of the mes. The ball rolls towards me faster and larger until I can only see static. I feel the impact of the boulder crushing me. I die. I switch to the other 'me' who rolled the boulder, and the dream repeats like this, with the ball getting larger and faster each time.\n\nAt some point, I wake up. I always have a migraine from the flashing static-y colors. Sometimes that is it for the night, and sometimes whenever I fall back asleep again it continues. I usually don't remember my dreams but I remember this one vividly, and every time I enter into it I know immediately it's Tumbleweed TimeTM.\n\nWhat's weird about this dream thinking back on it is that it seems very video game/horror game inspired; and yet when they started, I was a kid who hadn't consumed either of those yet in any capacity. I kinda wish I can have it again to recount it in more detail, but I do remember being panicked AF every time I woke up from it so xD\n\nCurious if anyone can offer any insight, scientific or otherwise?

There's always something of being afraid of getting pregnant in my dreams and also being afraid to tell my boyfriend and fears that he thinks that I cheated on him. The dream I had last night I was questioning if my ex drugged me.\n\nI have these dreams quite often now and I'm not sure why. I'm going to meet my boyfriend in person next month and we're not going to be that intimate because I don't feel comfortable with just protection and I don't feel comfortable taking Plan B due to some ingredients.

My curiosity got the best of me and I begged a friend to take me there.\n\nIts a steep climb up, but in this scenario my friend was a pilot and flew a helicopter in. You can tell when you arrive by the strong winds that create a barrier between Wind Island and the rest of the mountain. The tall trees also grew sideways from the wind constantly blowing one direction. The path is a grassy curve into an desolate arena. There's some people there sitting on rocks and logs and a swingset.\n\nThe thing about Wind Island, which I had forgotten until I got there, is there's monsters. They rotate; I remember seeing a new one each time I went (I don't remember the previous monsters). And you always sat somewhere high, whether it be the rocks or the logs or the swingset, because if you touch the ground in Wind Island the monster will attack and kill you in a gruesome and torturous manner.\n\nThis monster looked like a large horse. It was fast, and it got a hold of my leg and almost dragged me off a log, but I managed to escape. It didn't bug me after that. Instead, it focused on something else.\n\nTW death and rotting\n\n>!The swingset had a baby swing, and in that was a baby boy. He was stiff with his blue eyes open, and I realized he had been dead a while. My only thought was one of the popular kids brought their baby brother up, and didn't take good enough care of him, and the monster got him. Clutched in his fist was a stuffed horse. Maybe he saw the horse monster and thought he could trust it. The horse monster went behind him and was feasting on his back, which was eaten away to reveal all his innards.!<\n\nAfter that I promptly left with my friend in the helicopter, and shortly after that I woke up.\n\nLike I said I've been here before, but never was it to the extent of that horror. It's usually me vs the monster, not me seeing the monster had already gotten a victim.

I guess this jolted me awake and I could feel the tingle on my face when I woke up! After processing for a minute or two, I went to look in the mirror and my face was flushed. This dream in particular, even though I had always had very vivid, sometimes lucid dreams made me start paying attention to my dreamworld in a little bit greater detail I just couldn‚Äôt Understand how I could physically feel something that happened in a dream and have evidence on my face Even after waking up.\n\nThe next time it happened was a few years later. Last year to be exact I was up all night cleaning getting ready to move.And I had a very vivid flash dream as I fell asleep folding these clothes, I traveled somewhere in the desert and had three men that looked to be African or Moorishbased off their attire that resembled. They were standing in front of me one in the front, two in the back one in the front wearing gold dashiki with a matching hat that had two crescent moons facing opposite of each other and a star or a son in the middle of the two moons.The man on the left wore the purple dashiki of the same style and same logo on the front of his hat, and the one on the RighTS was green. I have never seen these men a day in my life, but the front man hugged me so caringly and whispered in my ear while giving me a hug. he said something in a foreign language along the lines of  ‚Äúson fun won gee‚Äù ‚Ä¶. He then kissed meon the right side of my forehead. Then he whispered ‚Äúremember child‚Äú. I then snapped awake.And rushed to a notebook to write down exactly what he had said because as I didn‚Äôt recognize this man, all I felt was pure love. As if he was a grandfather type figure. Which is a little wild to me, considering I am very much Caucasian, but I am in a mixed relationship. A month had passed and my kids kept telling me I had a heart on my forehead. They are seven and eight and I did not know what the hell they were talking about. I continuously brush them off, not understanding what it meant. I seriously thought they were talking about the shape of my eyebrows or maybe my 11 lines on my forehead. I had no clue. Then one day I noticed in the mirror that I had a heart on my forehead, right where that man had kissed and it looks like I‚Äôve lost all the pigmentation just in that spot and it‚Äôs a perfect heart.\n\n",

I would behave the same way I did in my dreams because of my paranoia. I was so terrified, I'd run out of my room if I heard a single tap on my window.

ANYWAY, the week passes and sunday comes. Me and my friend decided we were going to go to church together. We got to church mid worship kind of and just waited until the pastor came on the stage to speak. i zoned out for a little bit but when i ‚Äúzoned back in,‚Äù they were talking about the book of revelation. mind you i have NEVER in my life read revelation, the farthest i‚Äôve gotten in the bible was the book of mark and i haven‚Äôt finished. i did know though, that revelation was about like the prophecies and stuff so i was intrigued. then the freaky part, the pastor started reading verses, and it was exactly the same as my dream. hades, the four horsemen, the blood red moon. i sat there in shock because what the fuck do you mean?!? me and my friend just looked at each other in awe because it was so insane. after that we kind of debriefed what happened in the car. now almost one year later we still mention it from time to time because it was so crazy. im not a christian but i believe a little bit of everything, so this freaked me the fuck out. i tried asking the people at the church i used to go to for answers but they did nothing to help me. i stopped going to church a couple of months ago because it didn‚Äôt feel right, but the search for answers about what this dream means continues. this story sounds literally psychotic but i promise you its real. if any of you know what this might mean or have experienced something different please feel free to reply :)",

As soon as i turned to look at the ocean i saw the island with a huge ship and palm trees and very eerie presence. I asked the vendor do you see the ship by turning towards him and he said something i couldnt register. I looked back again at the ocean but the whole ocean was evaporated. No sign of water. It was a dessert in place of the ocean. Again i turned back to the vendor asking about the situation. He said that the land absorbes the water or something. Once i started looking closely. I saw a huge face in the sky made of black shadow looking for something on the beach. I quickly hid but i think it saw us group. The shadow came towrds us and grabbed the person who was trying to help me. The guy got unconscious and the shadow pulled him towards the island.  Next the shadow wanted me i guess but as soon as it moved i woke up. \n\nJust a iteration of a weird dream i guess.",

Everything feels off, though, like that weird dream logic where you know something isn‚Äôt right.\n\nThen‚Äîout of nowhere‚ÄîBeelzemon, as in the gun-slinging, demon-biker Digimon himself, busts through my freaking wall like a boss fight I wasn‚Äôt prepared for. Dude has his twin shotguns locked on me, and I instantly know I‚Äôm screwed.\n\nBut then it clicks‚ÄîI‚Äôm dreaming.\n\nAnd if I‚Äôm dreaming? That means‚Ä¶ I can fight back.\n\nSo, naturally, I go full \"Mr. Anderson\" mode. My clothes shift into the classic all-black trench coat, sunglasses just appear on my face, and suddenly, I‚Äôm Neo. Beelzemon starts firing, but I do the Matrix bullet dodge, tilting back in that slow-motion way where I can see the shells zoom past me. I should be scared, but at this point, I‚Äôm just hyped.\n\nWe start throwing hands‚Äîhim, teleporting and unloading shotgun rounds, me, stopping bullets mid-air and countering with some reality-breaking kicks. It‚Äôs actually one of the coolest dream fights I‚Äôve ever had. We‚Äôre smashing through walls, fighting in the sky, full anime battle-style‚Ä¶ and then‚Äî\n\nFor some reason‚Äîwe both just stop.\n\nAnd the next thing I know, we‚Äôre at Target.\n\nLike, straight-up, middle-of-the-aisles Target, just casually walking together. I have no idea how or why, but it‚Äôs like the fight never happened. Beelzemon is just chilling, browsing through snacks like this is totally normal. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm standing there in full Neo mode, wondering what the hell just happened.\n\nThen I woke up.\n\n",

    "content": "Last night I had a vivid and emotionally uncomfortable dream that unfolded in three clear scenes. Each one left a strange, lingering feeling, as if my boundaries were being quietly tested.\n\nScene 1:\nI arrived at a crowded local church, and the only available seat was in the very back. I sat down and realized that to my left was a girl who used to bully me in middle school and who was later also in my high school class. She didn‚Äôt speak or even look at me, she was just there, but her presence alone made me feel unsettled.\nIn front of us were several deep buffet-style metal pans, filled with soup and meat dishes. One looked like goulash, but the smell was absolutely awful, rotten, spoiled, repulsive. It was so vivid I could almost smell it in real life. I didn‚Äôt eat anything, just sat there surrounded by the awful stench right in front of me.\n\nScene 2:\nThe next part of the dream took place outside the church. People were standing around in small groups, posing for photographs, almost like it was a formal event or a big family gathering. At a distance, I saw a man I didn‚Äôt recognize, in his mid-20s, walking around with a camera and a flash, taking pictures of the groups. I didn‚Äôt interact with anyone, just watched from afar. I remember feeling a strange discomfort watching him work, like there was something off I couldn‚Äôt explain.\n\nScene 3: \nThe final scene took place in a covered terrace attached to a house near the church. It had a roof above us, so it felt semi-outdoor but still very much part of a private home. I was sitting on a couch that was on a terrace, scrolling on my phone when I noticed the same unknown man from the previous scene (the ine taking pictures) was now sitting to my left. On his left was my dad. Neither of them said anything.\nOut of nowhere, the man got comfortable, laying back on the couch and placing his bare feet on my lap. I was immediately disgusted. I hate the sight and structure of bare feet and toes in general, so having a complete stranger‚Äôs feet on me felt gross and violating, repulsing even. I didn‚Äôt say anything. Instead, I slowly slid to the side, letting his feet fall off my lap, then got up and walked away without a word. That‚Äôs where the dream ended.\n\nI can‚Äôt stop thinking about the unsettling feeling it left behind. If anyone has ideas about what this kind of dream could symbolize, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.\n",

    "title": "recurring dreams about someone I no longer talk to",
    "content": "I keep dreaming about a woman I used to DM with three years ago.  We talked daily for about a year and were very affectionate towards each other.  I was feeling very in love with her and still do have feelings for her.  Whatever was being said, those feelings were unrequited and I eventually had to stop talking to her because it hurt too much.  *Not* talking was also miserable.  I went to therapy weekly for 6 months, still going at least once a month.  In the fall of 2023 I tried to start talking to her again a little to ease my grief, but she no longer wants to chat.\n\nI can't remember if the dreams started before or after our final parting.  But I have these dreams a few times per month, it's been going on for at least a year and a half.  The first dream was of meeting her and having a conversation, and when I woke up and realized it wasn't real I started bawling.  Usually the dreams are of me just trying to talk to her, but her friends in the dreams distract me until I wake up.  Sometimes we do talk.  Sometimes the dreams are sexual.\n\nI think there's an energy cord between us because frequently I will run into her in public and we aren't in the same circles at all anymore.\n\nI had a session with a reiki healer who has been helpful for me with other issues in the past, to see if she can make these dreams stop.  It wasn't successful, but since then the former friend looks visibly uncomfortable when we see each other in public, and does her best to avoid me.  I've also tried various cord cutting exercises from YouTube which haven't helped at all.\n\nSo, I guess I would appreciate any insight into why I can not let this person go and how I can stop having these miserable dreams.  I feel like trying to talk to her about what I'm going through but she's already uncomfortable enough, seems like.\n\nMy therapist also doesn't have any helpful advice for it though at least she is supportive.",

    "content": "\nJust for context, I wanted to share this dream that deeply affected me. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder for a few years now. I‚Äôve been on medication since last August and have been dealing with dissociation ‚Äî mainly derealization ‚Äî for almost a year. It might sound clich√©, but I‚Äôve gone through some impactful traumas in my life, including rape and a year-long relationship under the control of a narcissistic abuser. I was also adopted, and even though I don‚Äôt suffer from it ‚Äî in fact, I‚Äôm very happy with the family I have ‚Äî it‚Äôs undeniable that my brain processes this trauma, whether I like it or not. I‚Äôm a tattoo artist, and my art helps me tremendously. I feel like I‚Äôm on the right path: dissociation episodes are becoming increasingly rare, the feeling of emptiness is fading, and I‚Äôm slowly rediscovering the joy that was taken from me during that toxic relationship.\n\nI dream a lot and usually remember them quite vividly, and I just wanted to share this one with you because I found it incredible ‚Äî it‚Äôs filled with symbols that make so much sense to me ! \n\n\nTHE DREAM \n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî \n\nI was living in the city I went to during my studies. The setting was incredible. I still had my cats and I was still in a relationship with my boyfriend, although he wasn‚Äôt home that night.\n\nThe night was special because it was actually bright as day, like in those places up North where it‚Äôs always dark ‚Äî except here it was the opposite. It was an extraordinary event: the entire night looked like a never-ending sunset.\n\nSo I went through my workday normally and then told myself I had to make the most of this exceptional night. I headed into town. All the bars, restaurants, and shops were open, and there were tons of people everywhere. It felt like a city festival.\n\nI wandered around, visited some shops ‚Äî I almost stole something, but I didn‚Äôt, because it was a cute little local shop and I felt guilty. Then I kept going, hopping from place to place, until I came across a bakery-bar where a tattoo artist was holding a flashday.\nI think she offered to let me join in and tattoo too, but I had no gear with me, and strangely, I was wearing a silk robe ‚Äî and nothing underneath. I knew it might make some people uncomfortable, and since I didn‚Äôt have my materials anyway, I didn‚Äôt participate. Still, I stayed there for a bit and drank one beer.\n\nThe night went on, and I decided to go home. But I suddenly felt completely out of it ‚Äî as if I had been drugged. I could barely walk. Everything around me was still normal, but my body wasn‚Äôt responding. I knew something was wrong, but I just didn‚Äôt care.\n\nAs I made my way through the still-busy streets, the crowds began to thin out. That‚Äôs when I noticed a man was following me. He looked exactly like one of my real-life tattoo clients. I was still totally out of it physically, and when I got to my apartment building (a residential complex), I realized he was still behind me.\n\nThe door to the building was wide open because people were coming and going. I started to climb the stairs, and I saw him pause at the entrance for a couple of seconds ‚Äî and then he stepped inside. That‚Äôs when it hit me: something was really wrong.\n\nI tried to scream, but only a squeak came out. I managed to say ‚ÄúOh no‚Äù, and he nodded with a disturbingly sinister look in his eyes.\n\nLuckily, a young guy ‚Äî kind of like a street kid ‚Äî appeared in the hallway. I immediately trusted him. With all the strength I had left, I screamed that the man was following me and wanted to hurt me. The street kid reacted quickly and kicked the man out easily. Police and paramedics were alerted right away.\n\nI was completely traumatized. When I got home, I noticed that one of the windows was open, and one of my cats had escaped. I saw her in the grassy area shared by all the buildings, and a child had picked her up.\n\nI ran like crazy, even though it was now pouring rain. When I caught up to the kid, I had to physically wrestle my cat out of his arms, because he wouldn‚Äôt give her back ‚Äî as if he couldn‚Äôt hear me at all.\n\nEventually, I got back home. I don‚Äôt think I slept. A few hours later, I met up with my boyfriend and one of my best friends. And it was like I had completely forgotten what had just happened. After a while, I started telling them about the awful experience ‚Äî how I felt like I had been drugged, how the man followed me, and everything else. But they barely reacted.\n\nI think I tried to change their reaction inside the dream, like rewriting it to get the response I needed, but I can‚Äôt remember that part very well.\nAll I know is that when I woke up, I was like: ‚ÄúHoly shit, what a trauma.‚Äù\n",

Learning this has brought back my creativity in dreams, and I was reminded of this recurring dream I would have when I was about 4 or 5 years old, where I was walking through the electronics isle with my mom and little brother at the store, and a video game that my little brother was interested in was available for demo play, and he ran up to play it. My mom said \"We don't have time for that, lets go, now!\" and she kept nagging at him to get off of the game so we can leave the store. But as she was nagging him, she fell over into my arms and her body combusted into flames, melting through her skin as she screamed until all that was left was her skeleton and the burnt ashes underneath me. It was quite traumatizing to say the least, but now that I have done lots of shadow work and understand that most of my traumas root from my mother and how she treated me and disappointed me growing up, I can't help but to keep thinking about this recurring dream and what it could've meant. Like I said, I had it at about 4 or 5 years old, and dreamt it about 3 times.\n\nThe closest that I can understand about it was the fear of losing my mother, because of how emotionally attached I was to her at the time. I was a very fragile and vulnerable child, who needed emotional security but was unable to have it. So these are the only hints I have.\n\nWhat are your thoughts????",

    "content": "I have this newly recurring dream (3 or 4 times over the last couple months) in which I'm visiting family back in my hometown, and it looks similar to where I actually grew up: smallish town, semi-arid, near mountains. But in each instance of this dream, there's an \"extra\" neighborhood on the edge of town that probably doubles the town's real-life population. It feels slightly removed from the rest of town and is located closer to the base of the mountains.\n\nThis neighborhood looks a little dusty, run-down, and more industrial, but when I \"visit\" it, I never get bad vibes or feel unsafe. If anything, I'm intrigued because I think \"why have I never seen this area on previous visits to my family here?\"\n\nOnly once or twice have I been able to explore much. I seem to recall that, as I drive into the neighborhood from the main part of town, dusk is almost always approaching (except for once, when I drove into the neighborhood in broad daylight). I think it was during that lone daylight visit, I went inside a fast food or fast-casual restaurant that had neon signs inside. I remember excellent-smelling food behind glass partitions (kind of like Chipotle) and there were a good handful of people who all seemed to be enjoying themselves and the food.\n\nThat's about all. I so badly want to visit this place, because there's something so enticing/mysterious about it. Maybe it really does exist somewhere, but in a totally different town that I've only remembered subconsciously?\n\nI've always been one to explore a place \"just because\" when I have the time, even if it means driving a little out of my way. Unfortunately, I'd have to *really* go out of my way for this one, since I now live on the east coast (U.S.), where semi-arid doesn't exist for a loooong stretch üòÇ\n\nI doubt there's any particular meaning to this dream (but if you feel differently, please say so!).

(6 days pre death). he said, \"i feel like no one gives af about me anymore\" and i said well i think about you every single day and he said yeah i know. then, it was basically a rerun of the last day i had with him, which was us watching 2 movies at a drive in movie with a whole setup in his truck bed. then he dropped me off and said well bye...\nand i was like wait dont leave and he said i have to, and then he drove off.\n\na friend of mine said that she also had a dream where someone they knew who passed came back, and also said that they cant tell you what happens and where they are. has anyone else had this experience?\n",

    "content": "A few weeks ago, I had a rather strange dream where I was in a dry forest at night. I was with my friend walking down a dark path, and a rather ugly woman with a more than horrifying appearance was following us. At one point, I looked back to see if she wasn't following us, only to turn around and find her right in front of me, but she was on top of my unconscious friend. She simply looked at me with her disgusting face, while she unbuttoned his pants with obvious intentions. I kicked her in the face and she suddenly vanished... My friend woke up and we continued walking until I magically went from being in a forest to a skyscraper, and there she was, only this time yelling at me that my time was up. The floor I was on magically changed shape into a ledge and made me slide to the edge of the building and fall, but my friend grabbed my hand and gave me a boost, preventing me from falling, and then out of nowhere, I woke up.\n\nThe truth is, the dream seemed a little strange to me because the day before I had that dream, my friend had a similar dream. Only in this dream, the one stalking us was a tall, bald man with a fork. According to what he told me, the man wanted to kill me because I reminded him of his daughter.\n\nI don't really know if the phrase \"time is running out\" is some kind of omen... I mean, I'm 19 and I don't have any life-threatening illnesses, but oh well.",

I made a joke about hitting it and he had to moved it. Harrison Ford is there because Jack Quaid is also chaperoning us and Harrison Ford is his dad. After Harrison Ford moves his car we start going on the track. And then we got stopped again because this guy forgot to put up thin plastic sheets that make the walls look like rainbow road. And this is where Pyro comes in, me and some ppl (friends in my dream, not IRL) are stading waiting for this guy to put up the little stupid plastic sheets and Pyro says to us \"Don't worry this guy is just a pleb\" but he misspoke and  said \"Peb\" instead of \"Pleb\" we all started laughing at him. I think to make a joke dream pryo says well I'm single and then kinda freaks out because we all start yelling that we are kids (16-18) and we start laughing some more at Pyro. Also pyro is in some weird sonic costume but it's not like dark blue it's light. And to end the dream I pulled out my dream phone and on it was some fat guy laying down but with the phone camera at a high angle pointing down his body on TikTok and on the video it had some text that said \"The guy who pisses everything\" I wonder in my dream how he does it and in the corner of the video I see that him and Pyro mutuals on TikTok, and then I woke up to write this.\n\nI swear I don't do any drugs. I'm just a peb man.",

There are certain features that are exactly like the original locations but they are all completely built/manufactured in my dreams and exactly the same each time.

    "content": "I don‚Äôt even know where to start because this feels absolutely insane, but I need to talk about it.\n\nFor years‚Äîsince I was a young teenager‚ÄîI‚Äôve been having recurring dreams about the same man. The weirdest part? I don‚Äôt know him in real life. He‚Äôs not someone I‚Äôve ever met, not even a celebrity. But every time I see him in my dreams, I just know him. It‚Äôs an overwhelming feeling of familiarity, like I‚Äôve known him forever, like we grew up together somehow.\n\nAs the years passed, he aged with me. In the early dreams, he was younger, but now he‚Äôs in his twenties like me. He has a very distinct presence‚Äîtall, with sharp facial features, short dark hair, and an intimidating look. But despite his appearance, he radiates warmth. In every dream, I feel an indescribable sense of peace when I‚Äôm with him, like all my worries and overthinking completely disappear. I‚Äôm usually very guarded, but with him, it‚Äôs effortless.\n\nThe most striking thing in all these dreams is his hands. They‚Äôre large, warm, and grounding. I always find myself holding them, and the moment I do, it‚Äôs like everything in the world just falls into place. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt even see his face‚ÄîI just hold his hand, and I know it‚Äôs him. His presence feels so real that even after waking up, I can still feel the warmth lingering. It‚Äôs like my soul recognizes him in a way my mind can‚Äôt comprehend.\n\nThese aren‚Äôt just random dreams either. Every time, it‚Äôs different, but the essence remains the same. We walk together, talk, hold each other, and just exist in a way that feels more real than anything I‚Äôve ever experienced while awake. The emotions are so deep that when I wake up, I feel an unbearable sense of loss, like I‚Äôm grieving someone I‚Äôve never met. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm missing a piece of myself that only exists in those dreams.\n\nHere‚Äôs the part that‚Äôs really been messing with me: I have a boyfriend in real life. He‚Äôs great, but it doesn‚Äôt feel right somehow. And whenever I try to convince myself that maybe he is the one, I dream of him again. It‚Äôs like my subconscious (or something else?) is reminding me of what real connection feels like. I‚Äôm not even a romantic person‚Äîif anything, I‚Äôm usually very anti-romance‚Äîbut with him, I crave it so deeply.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what this means. Is it just my subconscious? A past life connection? A twin flame? Something else entirely? And the craziest part‚ÄîI feel like I know his name, but I just can‚Äôt remember it. It‚Äôs always on the tip of my tongue, but I can‚Äôt grasp it no matter how hard I try.\n\nI‚Äôve tried to ignore these dreams for years, but now I feel like I can‚Äôt anymore.

He was so short his head was all I could see looking over the edge of the mattress. I asked what he was doing there seeing as I had locked the front door that night? He said he something to show me so I followed him out to the living room where 3 more aliens were sat on the couch waiting for us. Their feet were gecko like and didn't reach the floor.  Together we all went into the den, but instead it was a beautiful spa room overlooking a lush tropical coastline.\n\nThe aliens explained they had been trying to show folks this spa but everyone would get scared and refuse to follow. So I went to check it out. It was a pretty standard spa experience with face mask, hair wash, cute little drink (mint tea with lemon slices in it). Except that they also unspooled my brain.\n\nHow this worked was I was lying back in the spa chair looking over the view and the back of my head opened cleanly, without blood. They unraveled my brain and clipped it to one of those circular clothes  drying racks that hangs from the ceiling. It felt like a really good stretch except out of the back of my head, very weird. Sometimes my brain looked like guts, other times it was strings of fabric or beads and other times long gray twist of matter more similar to how an actual brain might be.\n\nThen they started removing bits of fluff and gunk from it with combs, which felt like someone brushing my hair. The fluff looked like lint and if you looked close it turned into TV static. The gunk just looked like snot. The aliens apologized for having let it get this bad. I joked they could remove some of my traumatic memories while they were back there, but the alien very sadly said he wasn't qualified to work so close to the brainstem. He seemed like he was going to cry so I quickly changed the subject and said how nice the accomodations were. \n\nThen the view changed to third person and they were putting my brain back in, which now looked like those magnetic string toys and snapped back into my head in a similar way.

Everything was familiar - the roads, buildings, and surroundings. We were near a bridge where a traffic police officer was trying to stop a vehicle, but it didn't stop. The officer threw a big bamboo stick at the vehicle's back, causing it to collapse and the glass to shatter. The vehicle stopped, and some other police officers from a different state got out and slapped the traffic police officer. After that, my father, uncle, and I started climbing a newly made staircase with a bridge. Then, the scene shifted, and I found myself with two criminals, a boy and a girl, who were killing people and eating their bodies. I was in a room with them, and the boy was cooking human meat. He started serving me, but then the girl came in and closed the door. They both started asking me for my money, trying to loot me. They told me to leave my purse and leave, but I wanted them to be caught. The weird thing is, I have no idea how I ended up in their room or what I was doing there. I escaped the room and ran through the balcony, where I found a gate. I used a pin to lock the gate, trapping them on the balcony, and then left the building. I found their scooty and drove it without keys to my old house, then went to the police station. When I arrived, the criminals were already there, and they were trying to negotiate with me. The girl said 'I can do whatever you want,(the girl was looking good and trying to flirt with me) just don't file a police complaint.' My mom was already at the police station,  The whole dream felt so real, and I was surprised by how calm and in control I felt throughout.

    "title": "Dreaming of someone who told you to find them in real life?",
    "content": "TLTR/ met a man in a world I had elaboraty dreamed of before, he told me to find him in RL. \n\nToday, I was spending a lot of time in bed and sleeping as I'd had a sudden bought of nausea that knocked me around, and so slept for about 12 hours on and off, with some slight redisual nausea. I had insanely vivid dreams, all which felt important - like I was saving the world in an alternate universe, lol - but none I really remember as starkly as this one. This is where it gets specific...\nI met a man in a place I had dreamt of before, which in my dreams I knew was my little apartment complex in a really nice coastal city, ai had seen the other parts of the city and even ridden on a bus into it, seeing the place from a mountain range as we decended. I'd been to the lakes there in other dreams, very like northern Australia or even Bali, or a mix of the two. I'd been to shopping centres and walked around the shops in other dreams. I knew when i visted this place, and could disrunguish it from other dreams. \nThe apartment we met in was his, and it was like he paid for top-teir accommodation rather than my basic apartment. And this man..I knew he was my soul mate. I can't even say it was just an innate feeling..we both spoke about it instantly and laughed as we spoke at the same time. We were then insanely curious about each other, I remember being so instantly comfortable that I grabbed him by the head and moved it side to side, really looking at him. He eventually peeled me off and wr talked - this conversation, I remember not much of..except that he told me to find him in real life. I remember stopping looking around his fancy apartment, comparing it with my own, and looking at him saying \"but this is just a dream.\" Now, I'm able to lucid dream quite easily, and these dreams in this world were always half lucid. The structure of the world was solid, I couldn't manipulate it, but I could do as I pleased, even fly, within it. This dream was the same, and after telling the man this, he laughed and pulled out a piece if paper. It looked like a resume, with his photo to the top right, and a few paragraphs with bullet points underneath. Right at the top was his name..and at that point I flipped. Could it be real? I remember my jaw dropping and looking at him, he hugged me and grabbed me by the shoulders and repeated his name, and to find him. I remember looking at the paper, almost panicking trying to make sure I would remember. It was like it was imperative to the very fabric of this world that we found each other, and I remembered his name. I have remembered songs I've written in dreams before, just simple verses or melodies, but nonetheless. \nI'm 70% sure it started with an I, and I'm pretty sure it may have been Isaiah. He even had his last name, something a bit longer. He was a content creator, or similar, maybe wrote books? I just remember laughing about how rich he was and teasing him about it, and him just smiling back at me. \nI can always tell when my dreams are ending, and when that feeling started I began to cry. He held me on his arms and said it would be okay. I remember looking into his eyes and him wiping my tears. I woke up in bed crying.\n\nNow..thisbis a longshot, but I'm wondering if this is subconscious or if it is somehow a connection with someone real? I believe in the metaphysical realm, but am also scientific minded..I have been getting into quantum physics lately and am fascinated with quantum entanglement.\n But maybe we can somehow reunite the two of us, if he us somehow a real person and not my brain subconsciously wanting connection...I am in a committed year long relationship, but we could have more connection I guess. But on the tiny chance he is real..\nHis name began with I, like I said, and could've been Isiah. He had dark short hair, full but neat facial hair, blue eyes, and the closest resemblance I can come up with is Ryan Gosling, but with dark hair. \nLet's cross our fingers and hope he's out there...but I'm also curious to know others opinions on this, whether anyone can give me insight to if this had happened to them too, or what the meaning behind it could be. I'm not mad if I'm told my brain subconsciously made it all up, either. Just curiosity, as this is such an elaborate dreamscape...and usually, there is only NPC characters in the dream, and I never interact with them like I usually do in other dreams. It's like there's only me in a videogame, free to explore, guided by the NPCs, and this guy was another real player. \n\nAnyway, leave your comments and insights, I need others opinions on this, lol.\n",

Like my head just sorta gives up and shakes itself from sleep. And when i wake up, I'm overwhelmed by incoherent thoughts. Too many of em. \n\nHowever today's dream was the worst. I don't remember much about dream except what was happening it. It was about me and my sister going to a university. There is a student in the dream who has concealed his psycho dad in the university. In the first cycle of the dream, I was totally unaware of the situation and I don't remember what happened much in between except that the dream ended with my sister dead. I woke up for an instant and then went back to sleep. The second dream was recurrence of the first one. Except this time I was trying to figure out what is happening and how to prevent it. I don't remember much but it ended the same. Then there were many cycles of the same thing and everytime i figured out something new and tried to stop in. I just know that in one of the cycle i found out that the psycho dad will escape and kill his son then kill my sister. I had to basically figure out where he is hidden and kill him first. \n\nThe most horrifying part was that there were times where I'd say to myself that it's and it's not happening. Then I'd run my fingers on benches and walls and run through the lobbies of the university and say to myself 'this is real and it's happening, it's not a dream.' It all seemed so real that I woke up and still felt like i had to go to university. It struck me that i was dreaming only after few minutes when i started forgetting the details and remembered that i will be starting university in Novemeber.\n\nIt scares me that I was so consumed by the cycle that it took me a while to differentiate between dream and reality. The only significant detail i remember is that there were no calendars or mention of dates in the dream. But the picture of my sister and my conversations with her felt very real. \n\nI also remember waking a few times in between and asking myself, if i was just dreaming or do i have to go through everything again and then going back to sleep and dreaming the same. I remember that none of the details left me and i don't remember much about the university but i remember that the son, my sister and the place where they were killed were so consistent that it felt almost continuous. \n\nI remember the son was lanky and quiet but sharp with replies. He had blonde curly hair. Blue eyes. White. Not exactly handsome but average looking. \n\nIt's a long post but i had to share this. I'm having hard time sleeping or keeping my mind calm when i wake up at night. I need some help or suggestions.",

    "content": "So I was sleeping as one does to have a dream, and I saw the tsu majo kashi on banner in a red tent like area, i was then laid out and all these images of sound bowls, incense, sage, a REALLY old book, candles, a pendulum, just kept flashing over and over like I was looking over everything in disbelief. All these images while a man is chanting over me repeating ‚Äútsu majo kashi‚Äù and something else that I can‚Äôt quite remember much of other than ‚Äúkejinayo‚Äù over and over. While all of this was happening I felt and overwhelming sense of pleasure in a specific area if you catch my drift, and when I and the chanting finished, I woke up, not groggy or anything even tho I only got like 2-3 hours of sleep. But when I woke up it felt as tho I was being watch‚Äôs up until my MIL woke up around 3:30am (I woke up 2 hours prior so around 1:30am) I‚Äôve been sitting here trying to figure out the language because it was written in kanji so I wasn‚Äôt sure what it said, but when I looked up based on what I heard it says ‚Äúkejinayo‚Äù means ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry‚Äù and ‚Äútsu majo kashi‚Äù means ‚Äúshe became a witch‚Äù and is is in Japanese idk about anything else rn but I am extremely confused as to why it was a ‚Äúwet dream‚Äù and why I was able to understand them in my dream but after waking up not understanding anything.

    "content": "A while ago I had a dream that felt so real. After falling asleep I woke up with my partner (everyone's faces are blurred in my dream for some reason), turned out I was pregnant and we got so excited. Couple months later I gave birth to my baby, I felt so happy and proud of being able to hold and finally meet my child. It zooms through hardship of me trying my best to make a good life for my child (the child isn't gendered due to the blurry faces and foggy memory of this dream) so they didn't have to live the way I did or go what I went through. Years later my child gets a partner, they get married, and have 2 kids. I meet my grand babies after birth then it zooms through me watching them grow up while also being there for them. Next thing I know, I'm on my death bed, my kid, their partner, and kids around my bed while we're at the hospital. They're smiling but crying saying it'll be alright, that I'll be in a better place and I lived a good life... I then pass away, but opened my eyes after that dream. I felt so hollow, empty, grief, and a gut wrenching feeling of never being able to hold my child again, to see my grand babies again, to hear both of their laughters as they grew up. I felt hollow for some time after that and still do till this day that I'm posting this. I also have had a feeling of me not being able to have kids or something like that but I don't actually know if I'm infertile or not but its just a feeling. Everytime I watch videos of people's children, babies, partners holding or teaching their kid(s), I end up either almost crying or I end up sobbing while the video plays on repeat because I start feeling that empty feeling in my guy again. Sometime I hold onto my stomach and cry because I'm afraid of not being able to have a kid or excited to have a kid. I don't know what any of this means but I've been certain at a young age that I wanted to be a mom. I've just had this feeling inside of me though for so many years that I might not be able to have kids or anything. I don't know what this means, how to help my situation on how I'm feeling, or even know how to get over this. I'd like to see what you guy's think as I genuinely have no idea how to go about this. ",

Sorry this post is so long! \n\nDream 1:\n\ni had a dream i was in england (probably bc of my obsession with heartstopper lol) but in this dream i worked at a Panda Express that was a sit down restaurant and also served starbucks drinks. it was my first day and an older lady ordered an iced brown sugar shaken espresso. i was trying for 10-15 mins to find the recipe and make it correctly, and people were getting frustrated with me, but not helping. i eventually just decided to walk home and on my way home i came across police and investigators pulling a partially dismembered body out of a trash can. i watched them pull an arm out, and then the lower half of the body (both legs were still attached, but the body was cut from the waist down). the trash can was filled with liquid, and there was blood all over the road. i watched them for a while before one of the officers nudged his head to my right, where there was a separate road for me to go on. i didn't notice it because i was so intrigued by their findings, but i decided to walk that way instead and let them do their jobs.\n\nDream 2:\n\ni had a dream that my mom, my boyfriend, step dad, and my biological dad all went to my grandparents house (on my mom's side). the house looked different in my dream, but i knew that's where i was. my mom kept getting calls from a random number and insisting it was my dad (he was literally there so im not sure why she thought this lmao). i was arguing with her, trying to show her that the number calling her wasn't my dad. out of nowhere, a bunch of zoo animals appeared, but specifically big cats (lions, tigers, etc). they were trying to kill us. i remember asking my mom if i should call the cops and she told me no because my grandparents would be in big trouble for having all of those animals on their property. i then stepped out onto the porch with just my grandma and she hugged me and told me she had cancer again. i hugged her tight and told her i love her. my boyfriend and i managed to escape somehow, but we decided to go back to try and save everyone. when we walked into the house again, i watched my grandpa get mauled by a tiger. there was so much blood it was kind of traumatic. i could hear him screaming \"this tiger is going to kill me.\" then, another tiger came up to me and i kept trying to kick it and whack it with my purse. i woke up as i was swinging my purse at it. \n\nDream 3:\n\nthis is a dream i remember having as a kid. this was after my parents got divorced. my mom and i were waiting for my dad to come home from work so we could all go out to eat together. after a while, my mom got angry and was tired of waiting so we decided to just leave even though he hadn't come home yet. i don't remember the ride there, i just remember walking into the restaurant and turning a corner. i saw my dad laying on the floor, dead, in a pool of his own blood. i just remember seeing him there and feeling my heart drop into my toes.\n\nDream 4 (last one):\n\nthis is another dream i had as a child. i remember being at my grandparents house yet again with both of my parents. it was getting late and i wanted to go to bed so my dad picked me up and started carrying me down the stairs to the basement. i remember trying to talk and freaking out because my words wouldn't come out. my dad immediately calmed me down and reassured me that i was only dreaming and i would wake up soon. he then tucked me in and kissed my forehead and that's when i woke up. \n\n",

    "content": "From a young age, I had a recurring dream that always followed the same story line in different formats. Every dream would involve establishing some sort of superpower for me to have, like flying or shooting energy beams from my hand, and I'd use the power fine, but then I'd be attacked. \n\nSometimes it was some sort of monster, other times it was just a person with a gun, and every time I'd try to use this power I'd just established to save myself, it wouldn't work when I needed it the most.\n\nI'd be unable to fly away, or I'd aim my hands and nothing would happen no matter how much I tried, and then, I'd die, and jolt awake in a panic. \n\nThe earliest I can recall these dreams is from when I was around 8 years old. The early versions of these dreams were simpler, like the example about not being able to fly away when I needed to, but later as a teenager, I would repeatedly dream about having a gun, but having it jam and not work the moment I needed it, and then being shot. \n\nAgain, waking up in a sudden jolt. \n\nI'd have a dream that followed these beats every few months or so, and it always confused me. The dreams seemed to finally stop when I was around 19 or 20. \n\nIn hindsight, I think I was just a kid with awful anxiety. \n\nThank you if you read this far.

It would always start the same, I would be on the bottom bunk of my bunk bed, and I would be imagining somewhere across the room, focusing on an object or two. For example, my most memorable one was a Minecraft chest. All of a sudden, I would get really uncomfortable and realize that everything around me was huge, but like stretching actively. The item I focused on was also huge but still the same size, only because of how far it was. As soon as I realized this, and tried to figure out what I was seeing, it would shoot away and start to shrink a bit. Then I would kinda jolt awake, but not like that hypnic jolt thing, just startle awake and when I did, I see that everything was the same as normal. I‚Äôve read online about Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, and think that maybe it was something similar, but it was only when I was younger and I have only experienced it once since then, but it was a few years ago.

    "content": "So, I don't really know how to explain it but the title says it all, I for some reason only dream of my pets once in my whole life, and it's at the night they passed, the thing is, I only had two pets I remember dying, and it was my dog and my cat, for my dog I knew he died, but for my cat I got the news after she died, since I was sleeping at that time. I'll just use an example of my cat since I didn't even know she was dead until she woke up, so it can't be anything about grief or such.\n\nSo, it was the night where I was at my grandparents' house for dinner, and when we left we all said what we thought would be our final goodbye, since our cat might not survive the night, and when we got back home I immediately got ready for bed, I was tired after a long day of worrying about my cat, school and helping my grandma prepare dinner, and when I fell asleep, I had a dream of both me and my cat laying on the double bed in my grandparents' bedroom, with her top half laying on my lap and her bottom half laying on the bed, and then she got up and started walking around the bed and wasn't limping, which was rather unusual, since she broke both of her back legs six years ago, and I remember just yelling something along the lines of \"Grandma! Katia (the name of my cat is Katia, btw.) is healthy again, I think!\" And then I ran out of the bedroom, and it was the end of the dream. Also a timeline reminder, it was during the dinner where my cat passed away, and the next day I wake up and immediately realized it's a dream, and it pretty much left me feeling even more worried and sad, and left me crying in bed, as I then sent a message to my grandma, asking if my cat is still alive or not. Which later on I already got the news that she passed after overhearing my parents talking about it, and then my dad came into my room to see me crying my eyes out since I heard it, and he just personally gave me the news and we buried her that day, where I didn't even want to go to an activity I love, and just come to bury her with my dad, sister and grandparents, while also venting to my grandma about the dream I had while my dad and grandpa were digging the grave and my sis was just walking around, and my grandma just told me that she probably came to say goodbye, which I should've expected, since she believes in the rainbow bridge and stuff like that, and I don't really know what to say other than that, that's the whole day since after that I was just laying in bed for the whole day, so nothing unusual happened there. So what does anyone think? Does anyone know what it's called, or the scientific definition of what it is? Or experienced it before? Since whenever I search it up it gives me stuff about dreaming of pets dying or that it's just grief and mourning, while in my case it isn't.",

    "content": "My dream about a Raptor with a minigun from 2021.¬†\n\nHad a seriously scary dream that reminded me of Turok (video game). It haunted me for weeks after with how vivid the detail was. I‚Äôve never forgotten those details, tried to convey them below, hope it doesn‚Äôt give anyone nightmares as it did me.\n\n\\-\n\nMy wife and I were driving into a car tunnel when, suddenly, all the cars in front of us slammed on their brakes. Confused about what was happening, a massive plume of smoke and dust suddenly rushed toward us, clouding the entire tunnel. Almost immediately, we felt an explosion, and in my rearview mirror, I saw the tunnel entrance collapse. Moments later, the track lighting buzzed and went dark. It all unfolded so quickly, it felt like it was happening all at once. From that point on, the only light in the tunnel came from our headlights, but the smoke and dust made it nearly impossible to see anything. We were shouting at each other to turn off the cars, terrified of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nWe were driving a 1983 Chevy Silverado single cab, with a Ruger 22 rifle providing cozy lumbar support for us. I turned off the truck, grabbed my gun, and started heading toward the other side of the tunnel, using my shirt to cover my face from the smoke and dust. By then, the smoke was stinging my eyes, and the people around us had become little more than muffled shadows. As soon as I started walking, the unmistakable sound of machine gun fire echoed through the tunnel. I quickly ducked behind the nearest vehicle, resting the stock of my rifle on the ground and cautiously scanning ahead. That‚Äôs when I noticed the tunnel growing darker and darker, as though the headlights were being switched off. After watching for a moment, I realized the noise was coming from a mini gun, being aimed at the vehicles with their lights still on. Whoever was firing it was deliberately targeting people in their cars.  \n  \nThe cars ahead of me soon realized they were being targeted and killed. It wasn‚Äôt long before every vehicle had turned off its headlights, leaving the muzzle flash of the minigun as the only source of light. At that point, I knew I had to stop this person. I moved cautiously, closing the distance to the minigun. When I was close enough, I could see clearly‚Äîit was a raptor operating the weapon. All I could make out was the beast‚Äôs silhouette, but for some reason, the hundreds of jagged teeth seemed to shimmer in the dark, grinning as though enjoying the onslaught. I stayed as low as possible, my rifle at the ready. The .22 might not have much stopping power, but it was better than nothing.\n\nIt felt like an eternity, but I finally reached the minigun‚Äîonly to find there was no raptor. As it turned out, the raptor had mounted the minigun and set it to fire so she could see, using it to hunt people in their cars. I could hear screams and the shattering of windows. Clever girl. I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint where the raptor was, but I knew I only had so much time before the light ran out. I slowly made my way back to our truck. By the time I reached it, my wife had turned off our headlights too. I looked at her and said, ‚ÄúI love you, but I think we‚Äôre going to die here.‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúI love you too, but thanks for the words of encouragement, Jesus!‚Äù Just then, I heard the raptor‚Äôs footsteps as the sound of the minigun stopped. It was pitch black. I fired a single shot toward the footsteps, and the muzzle flash lit up the raptor‚Äôs face as she crept closer, chirping softly. I fired the rest of my clip, then suddenly woke up, terrified, just before it seemed like I would have died.\n\n  \n",

    "content": "Although I hadn‚Äôt been to school in decades I was brought back to school at end of day. I go to get on a bus and they are all gone. I find out via other students that the bus loop is now somewhere else. I go to the location and I see the last one leaving. I decide to walk. I end up on a beach with many people and all the sudden a construction/billboard spawns on the beach and it starts conveying a message to me to pay attention. It tells me there is something sinister going on. At this time government officials start showing up and the billboard disappears but I can hear a voice in my head now telling me that it will be back and to meet them. I yell out where??? I don‚Äôt know where!! The voice tells me I will know when it comes time. The government officials have now taken keen notice to me and are heading in my direction. I make a run for it. \n\nA few seconds later a large black and white whale is seen breaching and heading directly at me diagonally to the shore line. It‚Äôs obvious that I am the target. The whale then starts a parallel path to the shore. This is what the billboard was referencing I knew. I grabbed onto the whale as it passed. It went a couple feet underwater for about 100 yards then went to surface again to allow me to breathe. Then dove again. It let me off back to the shore where I noticed an undercover agent. He gave chase. I went into a restroom where there was a homeless guy. I told him I was being chased and needed to hide. He recommended hiding under some sheets or towels after I dig a hole in the sand. I said thanks as I watched him take out a big roll of cash and start thumbing thru it. \n\nThe agent was outside the bathroom which had an entry and exit door right next to each other. I tried to go out door number one as he was coming in door number two. He noticed. We did a Scooby-Doo shuffle back and forth between the doors before I took off outside. I ran for it again. I made it to the woods when I encountered a maintenance yard worker who appeared to be throwing flares into the surrounding woods. Some flares would light up and burn, others seemed delayed and or wouldn‚Äôt burn. I thought it odd. \n\nI kept running and made it to an office which turned out to be the undercover agents office. I saw his cellphone on the table and files pointing to the fact the flares were destroying the forest so they could build there due to a loophole of sorts. This all clicked in my head as to why the billboard /whale appeared to tell me of this destruction of land. Just then I heard the agents coming. I crawled under desk to get away and my foot caught on the cellphone cord making a crashing sound. Agents rushed in chasing me. I fought them. And ran. They gave chase. I fought again putting one down and the next I put a jacket over my leg and told the agent to look the cool jacket. He bent over to look and I kneed him in the face to get away. Dream over. ",

    "title": "The Old Dream",
    "content": "When I was 21 years old, I had a dream that has stayed with me in such vivid detail that it has always felt more like a memory of a movie I‚Äôve seen or a book I‚Äôve read.\n\nThis dream was in fact two dreams which came to me over two consecutive nights. \n\nNight 1‚Ä¶\n\nIt is mid afternoon. I am alone in a very old, very deep forest. Trees of almost unbelievable size and age surround me. Some are entirely overgrown with the vine known as kudzu, creating an array of massive, organic statues. \n\nIt is beautiful, a magical place whose power is evident. I am also aware that it is not a safe place to be alone after dark. There are nocturnal predators who I know will be hunting once the sun sets. And this relates to the  final piece of information that I begin the dream possessing. I am there in the forest for a specific reason, which is to find my lost ‚Äúpartner.‚Äù\n\nWhat that means specifically - who this partner actually is- I do not know when the dream begins. But every fiber of my being is aware that my survival depends on finding this lost partner.\n\nAll day long, I walk through the forest. Hours pass, searching to no avail. Often, I want to stop and take in the astonishing beauty of the forest but I chastise myself to ‚ÄúStop daydreaming. The mission is all that matters.‚Äù\n\nIt grows later and later, and the sun is beginning to set. The light is becoming slowly but perceptibly dimmer. The shadows are growing, and with them my sense of urgency. Just before sunset, I see a light in the distance. Filled with hope that this is the clue I have searched for, I start walking quickly toward the light.\n\nIt‚Äôs a home, humble but projecting a feeling of warmth, safety, family. I walk around to the back of the house where I see a barn. The door to it is partly open and I walk toward it with a growing feeling of excitement.\n\nWhen I reach the door and look inside, I see a large, male, black Labrador Retriever. My heart swells with joy! This is the partner I have been so desperate to find! He runs to me and remembering the feeling of that reunion brings tears to my eyes to this day. Few moments of my waking life have come close to matching the pure joy - the bliss! - of that reunion.\n\nAnd the joy grows even greater when I look to the back of the barn and see a female Golden Lab who is lying down, nursing a litter of black and golden pups! \n\nI look back to my partner. By what seems to be a kind of telepathy, I say to him, ‚ÄúAh ha! So that‚Äôs why you left! Now I understand completely!‚Äù\n\nHe is so proud of his new family, and I am filled with a sense of the most perfect love for him that I have ever known. Also by means of telepathy, he tells me that he‚Äôs ready to leave with me now if that‚Äôs what I want and need. With no small amount of sadness, I tell him, ‚ÄúNo. This is your place now. That‚Äôs your family. She‚Äôs your partner.‚Äù\n\nWe both know it‚Äôs true, and as much joy as this scene brings us both, there is also the pain of knowing that the time has come for us to part ways. I walk out of the barn with him following close behind me.\n\nOutside, the family who lives in the house has emerged. They smile when they see me, seeming to understand who I am through the connection they have formed with my partner. I tell them that he will be attached to them now, and they are lucky to have such an amazing, faithful new family member.\n\nThey  tell me that I am welcome to stay too. I explain that I can‚Äôt, that my work lies on the far side of the forest and is too vital to ignore. They insist that I should stay the night at the very least because of the dangers out there in the dark. It is a very tempting offer, but I know that I can‚Äôt accept it. Whatever awaits me out there in the dark, it is imperative that I face it. It‚Äôs as if all the world depends on this moment, this choice.\n\nAfter a tearful goodbye with my old friend and my new ones, I head back into the woods. As the light of the house fades ever farther into the distance, the light of the setting sun also grows dimmer and dimmer. Soon, night has fallen. \n\nAnd I am becoming more and more aware that I am not alone. Whatever dangers, whatever predators call this forest home are now out there. They have my scent. I‚Äôm now being hunted and I know it. \n\nI‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm hopelessly outnumbered. The way back is blocked by the hunters. The way forward leads only deeper into an ever darker forest. But it‚Äôs the only way left to go. \n\nI hear them now, closer and closer. Though it seems an almost pointless effort, I do the one and only thing I can do.\n\nI run.\n\n‚Ä¶End of Night 1‚Ä¶\n\nNight 2‚Ä¶\nI run.\n\nThrough the dark forest, with the hunters closing in on me faster and faster, I run. I know it‚Äôs hopeless. They will catch me. They could overtake me any time they wanted to. They‚Äôre just toying with me now, playing with their food. They chase me. And I do the only thing I can do. I run and I keep running, never looking back.\n\nAhead of me, I see light. I don‚Äôt know what its source is but it doesn‚Äôt matter. It looks like hope. I‚Äôm running out of energy, of time. But perhaps if I can reach whatever the source of that light is I‚Äôll be safe. \n\nIt seems so far away, and that I can‚Äôt possibly reach the light before the hunters take me down. One step at a time, I run for the light.\n\nAnd just as I reach the light, I stumble and fall. Instinctively, I put my arms over my head and shut my eyes tightly, fully expecting to be overrun and ripped apart. But it doesn‚Äôt happen. Slowly I open my eyes. I lift my head.\n\nThe light is coming from the full moon high overhead, reflecting off of an open sky expanse of low, rolling hills. All across,, as far as the distant horizon, the land is covered by a blanket of pristine snow.\n\nAnd as I lift my head to take in the white vastness before me, I find myself eye to eye with a large, white wolf who looks at me with an expression that quite clearly asks, ‚ÄúWhat in the world are you doing out here alone?‚Äù\n\nMy heart burst with joy! ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù I think. ‚ÄúI have a new partner!‚Äù\n\nBut as formidable as my new friend is, I can‚Äôt help but realize that even with him by my side we are still hopelessly outnumbered. Seeming to understand my worries, the wolf looks at me as if to say, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it, do you?‚Äù\n\nHe turns his head to look at the snow covered, rolling hills behind him, and I look too.\n\nAnd in that moment, I see the most astonishing sight I‚Äôve ever seen in any dream, any waking moment, any movie, any story. The snow covered land stands up! \n\nIt is a sea of white wolves‚Ä¶\n\nA moment later, the hunters break the line of the forest too. The wolves don‚Äôt snarl, or bark, they don‚Äôt bare their teeth. They just turn to look at the hunters. And the. hunters, seeing that it is actually they who are vastly outnumbered, retreat very, very slowly, and vanish back into the shadows of the dark forest.\n\nI stand, awed by the discovery that I do not have just a new partner. I have an ocean of partners.\n\nI walk out into their midst, my hands stoking the snow white fur on their backs and heads. As I walk deeper into their seemingly endless ranks, I look up at the moon overhead. With every step, the brilliant white light of the moon, of the wolves, of the entire world, all blend into a single light. \n\nWith every step, I become one with the light.\n\n‚Ä¶End of the Dream‚Ä¶\n",

    "title": "I Had a Dream Encounter With 3 Beings‚ÄîIt Felt Like More Than Just a Dream",
    "content": "Last night, I had what felt like a profound dream experience that‚Äôs been sitting with me heavy in the best way. I‚Äôm not sure if I can even call it ‚Äújust a dream‚Äù, the feeling, the clarity, and the energy behind it felt different, like it was real on another level. This was the first time I‚Äôve ever seen beings like this in any of my dreams or experiences, and I think it might connect to some of the other encounters I‚Äôve shared before, especially my past abduction dream where I felt calm being pulled up into a craft.\n\nIn this recent dream, I was outside climbing underneath what looked like metal bleachers, the kind you‚Äôd find near a field. I don‚Äôt know exactly where I was, it didn‚Äôt feel familiar at all except for the bleachers themselves. As I moved underneath them and climbed up the side, I suddenly came face-to-face with three beings sitting just above me. They were elevated a bit, kind of looking down at me, and I was beneath them at an angle.\n\nThe moment I saw them, I said ‚Äúhey‚Äù out loud, naturally, like I had met them before, like there was familiarity. It wasn‚Äôt forced or nervous. It felt mutual. They didn‚Äôt respond verbally, but they looked at me, then looked around, and then at each other. It was like they were checking the space around us, or maybe scanning for something. I felt locked into their attention, not in a threatening way, just‚Ä¶ focused.\n\nThen, the being closest to me, on my right, reached out and gently touched the right side of my head, right around my temple near my eye. The second it made contact, I instantly felt and heard this strong buzzing or frequency sound. But it wasn‚Äôt just a sound, I felt it inside my head. It was unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced in waking life. Not painful, not overwhelming, just powerful and undeniably real. It made my eyes close automatically, and I felt something happening internally that‚Äôs hard to explain. And then‚Ä¶ I woke up.\n\nThe beings had grayish skin and were wearing fitted black clothing or robes that weren‚Äôt baggy. Their faces are hard to describe, almost like they were constantly melting or rippling, shifting in ways I‚Äôve never seen before. It was strange, but it didn‚Äôt scare me. The one that touched me with its finger grinned as it was bending over to touch me, in that moment there were no words, as soon as I seen it grin before it touched me I had this feeling of ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna be okay, you‚Äôre ready‚Äù, I felt seen and safe in that moment.\n\nSince waking up, I haven‚Äôt been able to shake the feeling. I still remember the sound, the sensation, the way they looked at me like they knew me. I wonder if that ‚Äúhey‚Äù I said was instinctual because on some level, I do know them. I even feel like I might‚Äôve heard a ‚Äúhey‚Äù back, not spoken aloud, but inside my head, telepathically. The energy between us wasn‚Äôt hostile. It was calm. Curious. Intentional.\n\nI‚Äôve had experiences before, UFO sightings, abduction dreams, but this one stood out. It was deeply sensory, subtle but powerful. I‚Äôm curious what others think this could mean. Was it just a dream, or something more? \n\nI tried to generate an image using AI to get as close as possible to how they look, the image above is the most accurate I could get it. ",

The grass was short and green, stretching infinitely in all directions, with no hills, trees, or any other structures‚Äîjust an open, peaceful landscape. Above me, the sky was completely clear, without a single cloud. The atmosphere felt still, silent, and mysterious.\n\nIn the center of this grassland stood a lone white house. It was built of what seemed like marble, though I‚Äôm not completely sure. The house had a pure, almost divine presence, standing alone in this infinite space.\n\nInside the house, there was an apple tree, and I could see apples growing on its branches. But the tree wasn‚Äôt freely accessible‚Äîit was enclosed within a transparent glass case, as if it were being protected or preserved for some reason.\n\nI also remember seeing a person sitting inside the house. However, I couldn't see his face. He wasn‚Äôt speaking or doing anything‚Äîjust sitting there, still and silent. His presence felt mysterious yet peaceful, as if he was meant to be there, watching over the tree.\n\nAt some point, I asked him, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù But he did not respond. He remained silent and still, as if my question didn‚Äôt matter‚Äîor as if the answer was something I wasn‚Äôt ready to know. A strange fear crept over me, as if I was approaching something unknown, something beyond my understanding.\n\nEven though this dream happened years ago, I still remember it vividly. It felt meaningful, almost as if it held a message or a hidden truth. Since then, I have never seen that tree, that house, or that person again in any of my dreams.

I sat with my sister, sharing experiences with her and relating to her, being now older and having slightly more life experience, everyone treated me as such, and I felt at home, something I haven‚Äôt felt in a long time. I kept feeling this profound since of love and affection radiating from all the members of my family, my sisters hand on my hand on top of my thigh, my brothers laughter filling the room, etc. I was experiencing what I can only explain as peak life, even for just as short of a time as 10 minutes, I didn‚Äôt want to leave. I even remember feeling my present self trying to get me to come back, maybe trying to retrieve my soul from this other dimension and back to my real body. Whatever it was, I ignored it, cherishing every single second of this wonderful time back. \n\nThe reason I loved this so much is because without going into too much detail, my family life somewhat fell apart after July of 2023, and I suppose my heart yearned for one last glimpse of familial peace, perfection in its truest form, love. \n\nAfter this dream, i awoke now flooded with feelings of love, affection, and happiness, understanding that my biggest want in my life is to be with my family, happy and content. Money, riches, fame, or glory mean little to me now, just 30 minutes later, I feel as if I‚Äôve been chasing gratification from the wrong things.\n\nFamily is beautiful, and it‚Äôs not something everyone gets to experience, and it‚Äôs not something everyone gets to fully keep, in my case. I believe whatever is out there, call it God if you want, sent me this dream to wake me up(ironic), allowing me to experience true love once again, but this time, letting me see that it was much more beautiful than I ever would have thought 2 years ago.\n\nI leave you, the reader with this, never EVER miss the opportunity to tell a loved one how much you love them. Never pass up the chance to do something special for your family members and close friends. \n\nOur argent asset is our time, and I am ashamed to admit that I wasted two years not even thinking about home I was wasting the endless love my family offered me, but now it all makes sense, I‚Äôd die for my family, and I truly feel for those who haven‚Äôt experienced a love like this.\n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this, take this as a sign to never take love for granted, whether it be a partner, a family member, or a friend. Love is something special, something that isn‚Äôt supposed to be taken lightly or unseriously. It‚Äôs to be respected and cherished. \n\nI‚Äôll close with my opening, because I believe that the Bible sums it up perfectly even if you aren‚Äôt religious.\n\nFirst corinthians 13:13 says \n‚ÄúAnd now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.‚Äù (NIV)\n\nThe greatest emotion, be it not euphoria, be it not drunkenness, or any other temporary feeling‚Äî is love.",

    "title": "I dreamt of a cold case",
    "content": "I‚Äôm not one who dreams very understandable dreams most of the time and even when I do it‚Äôs weird, but I just had a dream that was clear as day and it freaked me out. \n\nI don‚Äôt really remember what my role in the dream was but it revolved around the mysterious disappearance of a woman a few years earlier in what became a cold case. At first I got a feeling of what happened but didn‚Äôt understand it, and then I saw a higlight of the case on the TV (I think it was the anniversary of the woman‚Äôs disappearance) and I was immediately reminded in an aha moment, like it was super famous a few years ago and then nothing came of it and I then remembered it. \n\nAs to what the disappearance was actually like, and this is where it gets a little creepy: the woman was supposed to take a train like many others in a small town/village in what I think was germany/austria/central Europe, because it was a holiday (easter I think), but for whatever reason she didn‚Äôt get on the train. She then talked to an unknown man and got into his red car and they then drove away. Not too long after, the man returned to the town to get something and then disappeared. After that the woman was never seen again and the man remained unidentified. I think the leading theory was that the woman had problems with her train ticket and the man offered her a ride and somehow convinced her to go with him.\n\nIn the dream as I was listening to the case details on the TV, it was as if I saw ghostly shapes of the train, the woman, the man and his car and all that happened. Other than the man and woman, there were lots of people about, also ghostly shapes, probably because of the holiday. The ghostly shapes were colored but pale and made of mist. As I recalled the case and saw all this it was as if something dawned on me in the dream but I can‚Äôt recall what the greater context of the dream was, nor my role in it. I think I may have been haunted by the womans ghost but idk. The whole part about the case was scarily vivid and detailed and it gives me the chills just thinking about it. I‚Äôve briefly looked around now for any real world case that matches the details of the one in the dream but so far I haven‚Äôt found any. Parts of me hope it is completely false because it would be insanely creepy if it was a real world thing but another part of me feels like it is and it intrigues me.\n\nHas anyone else had dreams like this that creepes you out to the point that you need to look over your shoulder now and then? I‚Äôm not the superstitious type but something really feels off about all this.\n\nTl;dr: I dreamt of a women who didn‚Äôt get on a train and then got into a strange mans car who then drove off. The man breifly returned to the town before disappearing again. The man remained unidentified and the woman was never seen again.",

They were planets, they went flying past the earth in the sky not much farther then the moon almost like someone was throwing them at us. The final bit before I woke up they finally invaded with a robot army kinda like war of the world's robots or the robot from The Incredibles, only much more violent and destructive.

    "content": "I'm a very vivid dreamer, most of the time they're grounded in reality and I am interacting with friends/family/coworkers in places familiar to me. Sometimes they almost seem real. When I wake up its very clear that it was a dream, but I find myself sometimes getting lost when it comes to how I interact with those who have shown up in dreams before.\n\nA great example of this is a few days ago I dreamt I was out to dinner with some friends from work. It got kinda funky (as it usually does) when every time I tried to pay the bill the amount changed, or I just couldn't quite grab the right card from my wallet. However, I still had great conversations with some people from work that I've only chatted with briefly. In those conversations I felt like we were becoming better friends, and I learned more about them. When I see them in person however, the personality I had attributed to them in my head is just not reality (duh, it was in my head).\n\nI'm honestly getting sick and tired of my dreams doing this, especially as the more they happen the harder it can be to keep my expectations grounded in reality. The dreams felt so real, but they weren't. It doesn't help that most nights when I dream like this I wake up feeling that I'm physically rested but mentally exhausted.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar to this, and found any ways to cope with it?",

    "title": "I have never once cared to remember or write down a dream...until this morning",
    "content": "Dreams have never really had an impact on me. I cant remember any dream I've ever had and I've never been bothered by it. I've never thought of dreams being signs or manifestations for me. On the bright side, I've never remembered some horrible nightmares I've had, and i know i've had some bad ones. I woke up this morning from a dream that I remember so vividly.\n\nA little preface about me, I'm not sure its relevant or not. I am a 26 year old single dad. I'm a licensed electrician that works on a Government contract. I'm in decent shape and I am moderately healthy. Growing up, I've always admired the idea of love. From 3rd grade on, I've always had a romantic mind set and I have been a lover. I was always searching for love in \"crushes\" and I never had any idea what love was. My first serious relationship (or strong feeling of love towards someone) was my senior year of high school. I was best friends with this girl who I ended up falling in love with. I was a varsity football player and she was a varsity cheerleader. In the back of my mind I've always had an admiration for this previous relationship of mine. I'm sure its rooted in growing up seeing movie and fairytale depictions of \"Love\". Outside of that, she gave me some of the important firsts. Firsts that make you feel a certain euphoria. I can remember the warm feeling I got when I wrapped my arm around her, the exciting feeling I got when i stared into her eyes, the feeling of fireworks when I kissed her. It was my first relationship as a young man. It didnt last long but thats besides the point. At 19 I met my first true love, who is also my first true heart break. To make a long story short, we went from being young and in love and having 10x the feelings i previously described about my senior year girlfriend, to planning a wedding, to having my beautiful daughter. But as anyone knows, strong feelings of love come with strong feelings of heartbreak. Heartbreak that i would prefer not to live through again.\n\nOn to the main point of my post, the dream.\n\nThis dream was very short and very vague. But i cant really describe how its making me feel even after being awake from it for so long. The dream started in this sort of dark resort inside of a cave. I can see waterfalls and people around swimming. There is those foldable pool chairs that you see at many pools. I find myself sitting on one of the chairs drinking something. Along comes this girl who then sits on my lap. We cuddle up on the chair and she falls asleep in my arms. The dream then cuts to a field with a lot of my closest family and friends. I'm introducing her to all of them and she is showing off a ring on her hand. Two figures emerge from the field who end up being her parents. The dream ends as I wake up.\n\nIm writing this because of what I am feeling after being awake. When I first woke up, I was angry because I never really saw her face. I know she was about 5'7\" because she was standing next to me. She had an athletic build and I believe she was Pacific Islander. This wasnt a sexual dream and her build and skin complexion are the only things I saw. I sit here confused because in that small and vague dream, I am awake almost \"re-feeling\" all of those first euphoria's i described in the preface. After my last relationship with my daughters mom, I have taken a break from dating or seeing anyone. I tell people its to focus on my daughter, but part of it is because im scared to love again. This girl in my dream, that i have never met, has giving me this feeling of true love i have felt before. You may read this and think \"C'mon man, it was 5 minute dream and you never saw her face.\" I know... I cant really describe why its giving me these familiar feelings.\n\nIf you read this whole thing, thank you. If you're a dream expert, tell me if this means anything. If you're my english teacher from high school, I apologize for any grammatical errors. I ended up working construction and going to trade school instead of college. If you're my coworkers, just know ill still kick your ass even if i feel softy lovey feelings. If you're the girl in my dreams, please let me know. I'm ready to love again...but only for you.",

Till she suddenly says to me that she's actually there to sign up for a fight (she's never fought a day in her life) I'm wildly curious so I say I'm coming to watch. Except one of the people there distracted me with something unimportant and before I could break away from him she was gone, lead away by another guy who she said was a manager. So I run after where I thought she went and can't find her..  what's worse is the rooms I looked in weren't for fighters they were film studios for adult films... so I start panicking and get jerked awake..

    "content": "I‚Äôve had predictive dreams my whole life, when they come they are often repetitive and clear about a future event. This is something I am accustomed to- but today I had an experience that shook me. \n\nI moved into a new house last week, and just bought a small mirror to use as a vanity. It is directly in front of my bed. I know- that‚Äôs a no no, but I thought it was fine as my bed is large enough my feet don‚Äôt line up with it while I sleep. \n\nLast night I had a horrible night‚Äôs rest, I woke up about 2 am, and didn‚Äôt doze again till after 5. Once I fell asleep again, I had dreams but they were a blur- until the end. I was standing in front of a mirror, and was reaching to grab treasures I was seeing on the other side. Simultaniously, I woke up to my mirror falling and breaking. \n\nHere‚Äôs where it gets weird (diagram below for clarity): My mirror was set on my desk leaned against the wall. There are misc items set in front of it (makeup, perfume, etc)- and about a foot of space between the mirror and the edge of the desk. If it had simply slid off, it would have knocked everything on there on the floor. These items were pretty much undisturbed. The kicker is, the mirror landed face up. This means it lifted off the desk, did a flip, and landed. \n\nTo make things weirder, I have a medium sized statue of Guanyin (Bodhisattva of compassion) by my door. She was placed with her back to the wall, and is now about a foot out and turned. \n\nI‚Äôm extremely spiritual, and have had a number of unexplainable experiences- but nothing quite like this. If anyone has any insight as to what this may mean- please let me know. It would be much appreciated. ",

Come on, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù\n\nAs soon as we stepped inside, we heard people talking and realized we were in the 1800s. My boyfriend told me that the kids were sleeping downstairs and that we had to save them. For some reason, he made me go downstairs to put water and, weirdly enough, actual shit into a crockpot. But before I could finish, one of the workers walked in, and I had to hide under a bed.\n\nThe room had about eight beds, only one of which was empty. There were two adults in the room, and they all stared at me as I tried to fill up the crockpot. When I finally left, my boyfriend directed me out while he distracted the adults.\n\nAt this point, I saw everything through his eyes because I had already escaped. I watched as he threw something at the adults and ran out of the building through a different exit, opposite the way we came in. He met me back at our original entry point.\n\nAfter that, the dream shifted. Suddenly, we were inside a convenience store in a mall with another person we knew. For some reason, we were trying to escape from someone, and we attempted to jump into a movie channel‚Äîkind of like how it worked in Teen Titans (if you‚Äôve seen the series, you‚Äôd understand).

He said, *'She's alright.'* I was preoccupied with the cats, trying to keep the kittens together. There was a tabby kitten, gray kitten, black kitten, and maine coon. Who was possibly the tabby kitten. The black kitten was talkative, and had a bond with me. The gray one was my favorite.\n\nA few days ago I dreamt that there was a intruder.\n\nI had a dream I was looking at billboards and signs with my mom. Outside, before I was in my living room suddenly. I looked at signs, wanting to get photos of them. A few treehouse of horror themed signs from burger king was there. One was modern. They hung from the chandelier. There was other signs. Including other simpsons stuff. I looked through it all, distracted as my dad came up to the front door. He was wearing a submarine/diving suit. With a metal helmet. Green moss on it. When he took the helmet/costume off and looked normal, he smiled at me. I took photos of him as he did so. Apparently he was friends with one of the friends of my sister's husband, who died of drugs as well. It was vivid. Like a real exchange. There was keylime hostess cupcakes that I wanted photos of, along with a few other lime foods. Lindt truffles that were lime flavored. My mom was being a bitch. *'I always felt like a old person trapped in a young body..'* I said. Just then one of my little brother's walked downstairs and shot me, pressing a white gun onto the top of my head. I laid there, while my dad was holding me. My brother left the room with my mom, and other little brother; my family leaving the room. I called out for them. *'I never thought it would end like this..'* I said, turning around to see my dad's yellow skin. The hue was yellow, slightly. Arms around me. It almost seemed like my partner. I woke up after this.\n\nA few days ago I dreamt I was in the living room, watching ouat. I saw food in the room. I vaguely recall seeing blueberry lindt truffles. I think it was raining outside. It was a spring day. The neverland episodes of once upon a time were on. Use me by love and rockets was playing. Later, I was with my family in a room. I was wearing heels. They were thin, and one broke off. A group of people with different ethnicities were in the room. They were apparently related to me. Speaking in a foreign language. There were arabs. My dad was nearby. Flagpole Sitta by harvey danger was playing. I woke up after this.\n\nI had a dream I was at a school, then transitioned into a mall. In a classroom, I looked through a cabinet that had lilac milk inside it, pastel colored. There was another milk inside it. Other drinks.\n\nI thought about what clothes I want to wear for the summer, picturing outfits. Wanting clothes for spring as well. I woke up in my bed in a dream. I vaguely remember seeing my partner's face at one point.\n\nI woke up. Humans/oblivion by meat beat manifesto was playing, through my head.\n\nYesterday, I had a few dreams. In the first, I was being hit on by my sister's boyfriend. Then billy corgan talking to me. In the next dream, I was in my bedroom. I had a couple dreams about a nightmarish version of my bedroom. I found a cassette on the floor of the thompson twins. Shoegaze/noise style album. I then was in a liminal school, sitting down at a table with a nerdy guy. I felt comfortable with him. I was trying to take pictures of a jello pistachio pudding pie, and a rose pistachio cake/pie. A guy was staring at me. Hitting on me. I had a dream I was laying on a bed. My dad was nearby.  In another dream, I was in a slip dress. While in a room. I had a white slip dress on, as my nipples were hardening through the fabric. I unhooked my bra, tossing it. I felt the presence of a tall figure there, wondering if my partner was nearby. I also had the other dream of my bedroom, finding doors. One was at the top of the stairs. The others were against the wall. A couple of doors there. Across the staircase was a makeshift bridge, where a black cat was. Infront of me, beside another cat. I think there was a brown cat. In a weird dream, my mom bought me a baby blue tommy top. Saying that, *'You don't even like tommy.'* And showing me baby clothes with the lyrics to stay by lisa loeb on them. They were overalls.  I had another dream that I woke up in my bedroom, orbital playing. I dreamt of rugrats, also.\n\nI was at a library, sitting at a table. I have this reoccurring library in my dreams. I'm looking for vhs tapes and books there, with my mom. I was looking for big comfy couch vhs tapes, skimming through the titles. Collecting vhs tapes that I wanted. While sitting at the table, I flipped through a book. Grabbing food out from in the book, candy. A caramel egg, that was soy free surprisingly. I thought about if there was caffeine in it.\n\nToday, I could not sleep. Neptune in aries is conjuncting my mercury in aries right now. Neptune in pisces left, since it's transit from 2011/2012. Neptune is still sitting on my 12th house, though.\n\nI had a dream that I was with my partner, in a room. Laying on a bed. This was all I dreamt about. We kissed, as I laid ontop of him. He kissed my breasts, nipples. Licking them. Sucking on them afterwards. *'Lick my clit..'* I said, moaning after he moved downwards and got inbetween my legs. Lowering his body under me. He licked my clit pretty well, holding me ontop of him. I moaned, thrusting my hips. I barely remember any of it. Vague snippets of us making eyecontact flashed through my mind, when I awoke. I might've grabbed his face. His curly hair got my attention. I had gas, which made me stop my movements. *'Sorry..'* I apologized, feeling the sensation. Leaning over in a crouched position. He said something to me. Asking how I didn't know/realize it. I woke up after.",

    "content": "As a child, I remember every single night without fail for a few years, I‚Äôd have the same (lucid?) recurring dream. I know it was every single night, especially because the night I didn‚Äôt have it is a landmark day in my memory and was the night I never had it again. I still remember how disappointed I was. I‚Äôm unsure if it counts as lucid because while I couldn‚Äôt control what was in the dream, I could do whatever I wanted in the dream, it felt like real life, and I was fully aware that this was a thing I‚Äôd dream every night (and I‚Äôd look forward to it!)\n\nIt was a house that never changed. I wasn‚Äôt ever inside the house. I‚Äôd always be outside on the lawn and in the garden. The garden was split into four, with each section being a different season! I had winter with snow, spring with flowers, summer with sunshine and fall with fallen leaves. There would be a big table in the garden full of yummy food that I could eat, but normal food and fruits, not like the lavish kind. There was a porch that overlooked the sections of the garden. \n\nThe garden and the house were both small ‚Äî they weren‚Äôt big at all. The house wasn‚Äôt surrounded by anything but black void. It was a really, really comforting dream. No one else was ever there. No matter what happened in the day I‚Äôd look forward to having it at night. I‚Äôd fall asleep expecting it and when I‚Äôd start the dream, I‚Äôd have an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù feeling, like going to sleep was me making my way to the dream.\n\nI remember my favorite part of the garden was winter because I‚Äôve never seen snow in real life.\n\nAnd then, one day, I didn‚Äôt have it for the first time after years of having the dream, and I was really worried and scared I wouldn‚Äôt have it again. I never had it again. I really loved that house. I wonder what all that was about.",

I dreamed I was watching an anime about a teen mom who was trying to hide the fact that she was a teen mom, like one of those gag animes. I watched the entire first episode in my dream, and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out what triggered it. The last thing I watched before bed was The Apothecary Diaries (you know, with the handsome, flirtatious guy and Maomao üòÇ).\n\nIn the dream, I was sitting in the living room watching the show, and it was showing the backstory of this teen couple. The boy‚Äôs mom didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúruin‚Äù his future, so they moved away, and the pregnant girl ended up being homeschooled. After she had the baby, she started high school when the baby was about a year old. Her main goal was just to live a somewhat normal life, but of course, it‚Äôs full of misunderstandings. So, she goes to class, introduces herself, starts making some new friends, and when she pulls out her notebooks, a pacifier falls out of her bag. She quickly tries to grab it, but the other students are super confused. Their thoughts immediately are insane, but no one thinks ‚ÄúOh, she has a kid.‚Äù You know how they show those inner thoughts? One girl thought, ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs got a dude with a diaper fetish and he dresses up like a baby.‚Äù Then it shows this big hairy guy in a diaper, sucking on the pacifier and raising his hands like he wants to be picked up. Like, WTF? Don‚Äôt judge me, lol, I have no idea why I dreamed this.\n\nSo, to cover up the situation, the teen mom makes up this ridiculous story about soaking the pacifier in something for a toothache and saying it helps if you suck on it. Of course, it just made her look way weirder than if she had just admitted she had a kid.\n\n",

Last night I dreamt that I was outside my house looking at another person from across the street (I can‚Äôt remember who it was atm). We were waiting for a full eclipse of the sun to happen and we were smiling at each other in anticipation. When it happened it went from completely light to 100% dark. I felt my excitement shift suddenly to fear. Then, all of a sudden, I‚Äôm in the car with my mom and she‚Äôs driving. It‚Äôs light again but I notice in the rear view window storm clouds are forming, and I watch as a funnel cloud forms into a tornado. It happens extremely fast, and it comes straight toward us. I remember my mom is trying to gun it, but I know we aren‚Äôt going to make it and the tornado sucks us up. Then next thing I remember I‚Äôm at a sort of gathering with friends and family. My sister seems upset and is crying but she is elusive and says she‚Äôll tell me what‚Äôs going on when we get home. Eventually she tells me that a friend of ours keeps talking about how she believes she is going to turn into a werewolf and my sister is scared by this possibility. In the dream my mom also hears this and she and I both are concerned, because we both think this concept is completely unrealistic and we‚Äôre worried for my friend‚Äôs mental health. Next thing I know I‚Äôm in the room alone and I hear my mom let out a sort of laugh, like a laugh of disbelief, and it freaks me out. I say ‚ÄúWhat? What happened?‚Äù and follow her force, feeling fear and a sense of dread. I am worried that my sister has done something to hurt herself. My mom is quiet and pointing to something in the room. I‚Äôm incredibly scared to look but when I do I see a yellow snake slithering on the ceiling/wall. And I realize my sister has turned into a snake. I am relieved she hasn‚Äôt hurt herself but also freaked out she is suddenly a snake, and I feel intense feelings of sadness. My mom seems to accept it and lets the snake coil around her arm playfully. The snake slithers around the ground and I find myself wondering if my sister is still ‚Äúin there‚Äù or if she‚Äôs literally just a snake now. I reach out to touch it gently but startle it and it bites me. I start to cry and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to scare you.‚Äù The snake pulls its teeth out of my arm and is somehow able to heal the wound. It is then I realize she can understand me. She nuzzles against my cheek and I start to cry even more. I ask if she will be turning back into my sister and she shakes her head no, and I feel a sense of profound loss and sadness. I also feel worry that she may not want to be a snake forever, but I also wonder if on some level she is content or even relieved. That‚Äôs all I can remember. \n\nI have a few thoughts on how this could all connect to my life but I‚Äôm curious what others here might think? ",

I had a very bad feeling and knew that I was going to die. Then I had so many thoughts of regret on how I was so rude to my family and how I didn‚Äôt accomplish anything. Then it‚Äôs like I had the choice to go back or not, I heard it in my brain it was weird, I wanted to go back. Then it‚Äôs like I fell down back into my body and jumped back up.\n\nAnd all of this had very scary real feelings going throughout my body. Like when I was getting sucked up it wasn‚Äôt no dream I felt it in my brain and my body what was going on. Dreams you can tell apart from if it felt real or not but this was so real, I would tell you guys in more detail but it was so complex that it was out of my understanding and explanation. ",

    "content": "For the past few years, I have been experiencing sleep paralysis periodically, occurring 1 to 5 times per week.\n\nMy ears were always ringing, my body ached, and I would always hallucinate something or someone. Sometimes, the entities were recurring; other times, they were different.\nSome examples: a person standing in the corner, elongating their neck until their head was right in front of me; an eight-legged, completely black ‚Äúhuman‚Äù crawling along the walls or ceiling into my bed, squeezing my limbs and causing unbearable pain; masked people in robes standing around my bed, resembling a cult; or something clinging to my shoulders, pressing its fingers into my armpits, which was also really painful.\n\nRarely was I actually anxious since I was aware it was all in my head. I always tried to move as much as I could to wake up‚Äîonly to fall asleep again and experience the same thing all over. Occasionally, I had a lucid dream afterward.\n\nMy idea was that since it was all in my head, I should decide who was allowed in. So I learned lucid dreaming‚Äînot to the extent of controlling my dreams every night, but just enough to take control after sleep paralysis. There I was, lying in bed, unable to move, staring the monster in the eyes with full intention to fuck it up. I entered a lucid dream, stood up, and beat them up. After a while, they started running away, jumping through the window onto the street. So I followed them, making sure they wouldn‚Äôt come back. I became my nightmare‚Äôs nightmare, lol.\n\nNowadays, my sleep paralysis isn‚Äôt scary anymore‚Äîmy body doesn‚Äôt hurt, and my ears don‚Äôt really ring. My hallucinations now consist of either a cute animals or an attractive woman who comforts me and with whom I can have conversations about things I can‚Äôt discuss with others. I wake up happy and no longer exhausted.",

Then we discovered this homeless man that would constantly walk around the house so we locked the doors. I saw him in the garage too, assuming this is a day or ao later i get a message from a friend from school :EMERGENCY, there was an accident involving someone earlier, lock your doors and stay out of sight, even starving is better then the fate you will find if you don‚Äôt protect yourself: id yelled at everyone to stay in my room but later that same friend came telling us he found a way to escape,so id went out to the porch to see a dark almost greenish hew of the sky, i was following him with a horrible sense of dread over me. but the truck the friend had had only had space for 4 people and i wouldn‚Äôt have saved everyone. I chose the people over saving myself. (Didnt think about throwing a few in the trunk for some reason) i was about to run inside when i felt a dark presence near me and i saw a giant black humanoid flesh creature, with skinny legs and skinny arms, and a messed up face. I knew it was the poor homeless man, i didnt see proof but i knew it was him immediately. It was like a vision of what had happened while i was talking to  the friend so when  i did enter i had seen the ground torn apart and lights broken, something had been in there by then. I check my room and see holding a mangled body and it trying to kill one more of the people hiding in my house, but then it just died. Im not sure what happened after that all i remember is a clear blue sky. The face of the monster is stuck in my head ",

    "title": "Hadn‚Äôt Dreamed in Years‚ÄîThen Everything Changed",
    "content": "I was doing edibles or smoking the real thing (one day this, one day that..) for a couple of years and during that time I never dreamed. I didnt pay mind to that but It was something that I noticed since when others casually mentioned a dream they had, I remember thinking that any dreams I had was years ago and I attributed the lack of dreaming to my adult age. Well‚Ä¶.\nI have 3 months free of doing edibles and smoking and‚Ä¶ I dream every day! It‚Äôs crazy! I also feel my mind more stable and I feel more control over my emotions. But this post is how amazed I am that every night I have vivid dreams with powerful emotions‚Ä¶ I didnt have that for yearssssss when I smoked or did edibles‚Ä¶ I wonder scientifically‚Ä¶ why that is?\n\n\n\nEdit:: I asked ChatGPT and this is what it returned.\n\nWhy do dreams come back after quitting weed?\n\nCannabis (whether smoked or eaten) affects your REM sleep, the stage of sleep where most vivid dreams happen. When you use weed regularly, it tends to suppress REM sleep, which leads to fewer dreams or no memory of dreaming at all. So when someone stops, the brain rebounds‚Äîthis is called REM rebound‚Äîand suddenly, dreams come back stronger, more vivid, and sometimes even intense.\n\nWhat does that imply?\n\t1.\tYour brain is rebalancing: It means your sleep cycles are returning to their natural rhythm.\n\t2.\tMemory and emotional processing might improve: REM sleep is deeply linked to memory consolidation and emotional healing. When you dream again, your brain is working through things more naturally.\n\t3.\tYour endocannabinoid system is resetting: Weed interacts with this system, which regulates mood, sleep, appetite, and more. Removing weed gives this system time to recalibrate.\n\nWhat part of the brain is responsible for dreaming?\n\nDreaming, especially during REM sleep, is a complex process involving multiple areas:\n\t‚Ä¢\tPons: Located in the brainstem, it helps trigger REM sleep and sends signals to the rest of the brain.\n\t‚Ä¢\tThalamus: Acts like a relay station, sending sensory information to the cortex (but it‚Äôs mostly turned off during deep sleep‚Äîmore active in REM).\n\t‚Ä¢\tAmygdala: Processes emotions, which is why dreams often feel emotionally charged.\n\t‚Ä¢\tHippocampus: Deals with memory, so it helps pull pieces of your experiences into your dreams.\n\t‚Ä¢\tPrefrontal Cortex: This part, which handles logic and decision-making, is less active during dreams, which is why dreams can feel so illogical or surreal.\n\nSo dreaming again is a powerful sign that your brain is healing, rebalancing, and returning to its natural rhythm. It can even be symbolic of waking up to more of yourself.",

But then when I went to leave, I couldn't find the exit. I kept feeling like I was rushed and didn't have enough time/wasn't moving fast enough.\n\nI managed to eventually find my way out, and it turns out that was a dream inside a dream. There was a weird jump and then I was in I think a farm? It had large green fields on either side of a long, winding path that splintered off into different parts like a maze. I went into this farmhouse and met 2 or 3 girls. I explored the house with them before realizing I couldn't find the exit. I went to them for help and they helped me to the exit. I took a picture of them on my iPad because they helped me and I wanted to remember them, but I remember my iPad being really weird. Any time i went into the photos app, the environment around me would change. (If anyone has seen that one guy playing ai Minecraft, it felt like that). I then tried to find my way out of the farm itself, but got really lost. I ran back to the farmhouse, but it was different somehow. I was crying at this point, and they once again helped me to the exit. I woke up still in my dream and went to my dance studio, where I talked to my oldest sister and told her about it. I mentioned the thing with my iPad and she agreed that she'd been having the same dreams, and mentions that they've been happening since our parents got a new basement door. We were then in a dream inside a dream together in my school. We were confronted by the people in my school's musical, the lead stood out in particular. I started questioning him while hitting him with a metal waterbottle that didn't do anything, and he revealed that he was actually just an evil doppelg√§nger of our lead, and then they started chasing us and we still could find the exit, and then I woke up. Idk if it's bc I went to bed late or what but im just. really confused?? ",

The family who lived there welcomed me warmly and imvited me to stay with them for a while. There was the father, who did most of the talking, the mother, and the two kids who didn't seem to do much. In fact I started to think something was weird. After dinner I was just hanging around when I (foolishly) opened a little hatch door in the kitchen floor. There was some sort of cellar, but it was full of dead people. Like a literal pile of corpses, the one on top of the pile still had a bloody knife in the back. \n\nThe mother remained perfectly calmed and said something like \"there's 140 corpses in there, yep\". And the father immediately decided he was going to kill me for this. He chased me around the house, I escaped by jumping from a window on the 2nd floor and ran into the forest.\n\nRunning away was difficult because I realized I was running on dead deer. Hundreds of dead deer, which I somehow understood to be victims of the angry father (he had no name btw). I understood he simply liked to kill for the sake of it. \n\nI somehow ran foe a while but only made it back to the house where I was captured by the mother. That's when a police car arrived. 2 cops came out. I was so happy to be saved that I flipped off the entire family (the father was still outside) and told them to f themselves. \n\nUnfortunately the father sneaked behind a cop, stabbed him in the neck, stole his gun and shot the 2 cops dead. Then I think he killed me and I woke up. \n\nMy description is maybe not perfect but the dream was so vivid it scared the crap out of me. ",

At some point idk how I managed to override that Jekyll & hyde situation within myself and came back to my senses.

I waited and tried to fight them off but I was thwon to the ground and held there. When I was pinned down, some people in white lab coats stabbled a needle on my neck.

Since then, I've done so a few times, usually just for five minutes or so.\n\nWell, this morning, I was in church and, as has been my habit during Lent, was doing Lectio Divina while waiting for the service to start in the pews. Lectio Divina basically means that you read a piece of scripture, reread it while reflecting on what it says to you, pray about the topic of your reflection, and then spend 10 minutes or so \"resting in God\" and just chilling. Well, during that last part, I usually start to fall asleep lol. The same thing happened today and I started to nod off and have one of those half-asleep dreams. It was very short: I could see a thick, heavy book with the pages being rapidly flipped through by an unseen hand. On the pages were rows of Hebrew letters. I grew up Jewish, so it reminded me of the Siddur. It was being flipped through so rapidly that most of the letters were just a blur, but one letter stood out to me and remained with me when I woke up. It was the Hebrew letter *mem* (with a dagesh mark inside).\n\nNow, I haven't studied a lick of Hebrew since I was an elementary schooler, so I had to do some Googling to even find out that the letter was mem. This brought me to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mem), which to my surprise read:\n\n>Mem is associated with [The Hanged Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hanged_Man_(tarot_card)) (Atu XII), the element of water and the path between Geburah and Hod on the Tree of Life.\n\nMem also stands for the number 40 in numerology, and given I'm in the middle of the 40 days of Lent, is also relevant in that way.
