    "content": "Throwaway account because I'm honestly a bit embarassed about how much this is bothering me.\n\nSo my mom passed away 4 years ago. Having dreams about her is not unusual, but not as frequent as it used to be. Last night I had a very vivid dream where I saw her and it felt very realistic. I hugged her and we hung out for awhile. Usually in my dreams she isn't a dead person visiting me, she's alive and usually there's been like some mistake where everyone thought she was dead but she wasn't. Anyways, flash forward a little bit and she's laying in bed dying again (this is another common occurrence of these dreams) I said something like I wish she could have stayed longer, and she said something like, \"oh you don't need to worry, you'll be joining me soon.\" That really freaked me out. One thing to note is I am not a very spiritual person, I'd like to believe that really is my mom visiting me in dreams, but I also am skeptical of everything. My mom believed that her deceased loved ones would actually appear to her in dreams sometimes, so because of that I'm freaking out that this is real. I CAN'T die soon, I have family on Earth who needs me. I'm only 25 years old, I've just begun to heal from severe depression and mental illness. I haven't lived yet. I don't want to die. Please knock some sense into me. Thank you",

    "title": "I got to see my sister and meet my niece last night in a dream",
    "content": "For some quick context, my older sister was murdered in late 2021 and she was 7 months pregnant at the time. Both her and her baby died. \n\nLast night I was having a dream that took place in the neighborhood where I grew up. This was one of those dreams that just felt so real and vivid. I was walking around the streets when I ran into my sister. She was holding her baby who appeared as an infant in the dream. I hugged her, crying, and started leading her to my parent's house. I've never lucid dreamed before and I can never realize when I'm in a dream, but part of me knew this couldn't be reality. I remember I just kept repeating \"we need to find someone so I can make sure this isn't a dream\", because I thought that would somehow prove it was real.\n\nI couldn't find anyone since nobody was home, so we both sat at the kitchen table. At this point my worries about it being a dream were starting to fade. I chatted with her, so happy to get another chance to talk to her (this had been one of my biggest regrets after her death. COVID had been running rampant for a while when she was killed, so I hadn't gotten the chance to see her in person for nearly 2 years at that point. I'm also the kind of person who rarely texts. I just wait until the next time I see someone to catch up).\n\nShe introduced me to my niece. I got to hold her and see her, something I never got the chance to do since she never got the chance to be born. She was a beautiful baby.\n\nThen the dream took a dark turn, as they tend to do for me. The baby went limp, dying in my arms right before I woke up.\n\nObviously the end of the dream is quite disturbing, but I'm used to morbid and distressing topics invading my sleep; most of my dreams these days tend to be leaning into nightmare territory. Overall, it was a very nice dream. I got to experience something I'll never get the chance to in my conscious state. Since I didn't know I was dreaming, I didn't get the chance to say goodbye to my sister, but I got to see her again, talk to her again, and meet my niece.\n\nI know that it was all just a dream, but it's nice to think that there's the smallest chance that I was somehow actually seeing her one last time.",

    "title": "Met a lady in real life who I used to have recurring dreams about",
    "content": "           This is long/.  When I was a child I used to have the strangest dreams. Not nightmares but like the weird ones where the dream characters find out you’re dreaming and they aren’t supposed to. Or like dreams that seem to have a whole connecting plot and it seems like I wake up on cue. I was aware I was dreaming a lot of the time but never fully “lucid” to where I could control the dream it was like me knowing I was dreaming was apart of the dream if you get what I mean. Just strange dreams in general which have pretty much stopped happening entirely after i entered my early teens. I actually remember a lot of them.\n\n    A lot of my weird dreams were recurring but this one always stuck out to me because it involved the same character but the dream itself was different every-time. There was a house in my neighborhood that no one lived in. The dream would always start with me walking out my house at night and walking over to the empty house in my neighborhood. All the houses were dark and unlit except the house no one lived it. The windows would be open and you could see the light coming through. And there was a little Puerto Rican lady that lived there and she spoke really broken English.\n\n    I remember the first time I had the dream and I met the lady. It started with me walking outside and coming to the empty house but it was all lit up and homey. I was confused for a second and then I realized I must have been dreaming so I thought nothing of it and I walked up to the door and just walked inside. The lady was there and I wasn’t scared or anything I just sat down with her. I don’t remember all the details but I know it felt like we talked for hours just about life. I had to have been no older then 8. \n\n  I dreamt of her many times after that and she was almost like an imaginary friend but only in my dreams. I would talk about problems at school and at home and she would tell me about her life. I remember one time I asked her if she could come see me in real life and I don’t really remember her answer but I remember me being aware that she was truly just a dream and she seemed to know that too. I eventually stopped having those dreams but I always remembered her. I was always scared to walk by the house in real life.  \n\nCome to present day I am married and have told my husband about these dreams years ago. I started a job at a retail store a little over a year ago now. I still work there. Pretty much all of our customers are regulars we don’t get too many new faces. A couple months after I started there was a woman shopping who I took notice of really quickly because she just looked so familiar. I was so confused because I thought there was no way I could know this woman like there’s just no possible way. Nothing could have added up to make sense of where I knew her from but I just had this super strong feeling that I knew her really well like I felt like I wanted to give her a big hug and tell her I missed her lol. \n\n   I thought i was just being silly until she actually approached me the next time I saw her. Like I said, the woman in the dream didn’t really speak good English the in real life lady didn’t either. But she approached me like she knew me with a smile on her face she said, “how are you? Beautiful girl” and kind of leaned in for a hug. I was so confused still maybe thinking I knew her from somewhere because she seemed to know me too, so I hugged her back and tried to like  act normal because I didn’t want to be rude if I actually knew this lady. She small talked me for a little bit and then we said our goodbyes. I walked away still confused and trying to figure out where I know her from and it clicked . I swore she was the lady from my childhood dreams.. I know I sound crazy lol I told my husband and he thought it was creepy but obviously didn’t think much of it. \n  \n    I know it’s really crazy but after a year of working there, she still comes in always happy to see me. She always gives me hugs and asks how I’m doing and tells me I’m so pretty. It’s like the weirdest thing because it became normal to see her and I almost view her as just a normal regular that I have a great connection with but I still can’t get over the whole dream thing. There was never a formal introduction with this lady it’s like it’s just always been an unspoken thing that we are really good and everytime we see each other in my store we just have a connection like we’ve know each other for years. I don’t even know her name but she’s acted like she’s know me since day one and she’s never questioned how or where we know each other either. At this point it feels like I know her from work but I never even really met her she just walked up one day like she knew me and we’ve had interactions like that lever since. \n\nI thought my experience was interesting and I just really wanted to get this out there to others who may have had similar experiences or insight.

He came up to my flat, drank my wine and smoked my cigarettes. He asked me to put music on. He used his phone to order more wine but loads of students started filling the flat. Later I went down to him. I found him tucked up under blankets in a mattress. He told me to get in beside him. I wanted to know why he cared so passionately about people. I put an arm round him and caressed his hair. We kissed, deeply. Again we needed cigs and wine. He tried to order on my phone but there was only £3 in my bank. Whether he minded that I was poor I don’t know. I’m not sure if he cared that I was older or overweight. He seemed lovely and wanted music and deep discussions. But again the crowds of students took over the flat and the landing. It prevented me getting near him. One father even let his toddler piss on the carpet and down the stairs. Not sure how this dream ended. I loved feeling wanted, loved Owen and was frustrated we couldn’t have time together.",

    "title": "The Triangle-Headed Beings From My Dream – A Contact Event Through Dreamstate (Drawing Included)",
    "content": "Over the past few months, I’ve been having profound dreams and meditations that feel like more than just internal experiences, they feel like real contact events. On March 29, 2025, I had the most powerful one yet. In this dream, I encountered three beings whose appearance, energy, and presence have stuck with me like nothing else I’ve ever known.\n\nAttached is a drawing I made from memory, completely guided by instinct, no hesitation, no second-guessing. It flowed out of me like I was remembering, not imagining.\n\nWhat They Looked Like:\n\n\t•\tHead: An upside-down triangle, with no eyes or nose, just a small slit for a mouth. Their faces were not still, they were constantly melting or rippling downward, almost like static or flowing light, impossible to fully grasp. This wasn’t just an alien “face”, it felt like a representation of something interdimensional, a form my human mind could barely comprehend.\n\n\t•\tBody: Covered in a black, fitted robe, not bulky, not loose. It seemed to hug their form but still flowed in a subtle, almost liquid way. No visible feet. Their hands were grayish, smooth and narrow, not pale, but distinctly not human. One of them touched my temple, and the second that happened, I felt a powerful buzzing/frequency flood through my body and mind, and my eyes closed involuntarily in the dream.\n\nWhat the Symbols Mean (As I’ve Researched & Felt It):\n\n\t•\tUpside-Down Triangle: This shape has ancient esoteric significance, connected to divine feminine energy, water, intuition, and receptivity. To see them with triangle-shaped heads might be symbolic of their non-linear perception and deeper alignment with universal consciousness.\n\n\t•\tThe Black Robe: Black represents mystery, the unknown, the hidden. But robes, especially fitted, can also mean initiation, sacred ceremony, or even guardianship. These weren’t hostile beings. Their presence was intimate, calm, and deeply sacred. It felt like I had entered a temple or space outside of time.\n\n\t•\tThe Rippling Face: I believe their real form may exist beyond the visible light spectrum. The constant shifting face could be a translation my brain rendered in a way it could process. I felt they were showing me only what I could handle, and even then it was nearly impossible to articulate.\n\nThe State I Was In:\n\nI wasn’t lucid dreaming in the traditional sense, I couldn’t control anything, but I was 100% aware I was myself, grounded in who I am. It felt planned, like I was dropped into a moment already unfolding, and I was meant to witness it.\n\nIt didn’t feel like a dream. It felt real, like I was in another realm, another layer of reality. These beings didn’t feel foreign. They felt familiar, like I’ve known them before.\n\nWhy This Was a Contact Event:\n\n\t•\tThis occurred 4 days after a profound meditation where I asked, “Will you please show me you?” During that session, I felt a golden light surround me and warmth on my forehead, close to where one of the beings touched me in the dream (on my temple).\n\n\t•\tThe dream occurred during strong solar activity and a waning moon, which I’ve noticed aligns with most of my contact experiences. These energetic shifts may be “open windows” for contact in altered states.\n\n\t•\tAnd most importantly, I didn’t feel fear. I felt curious, peaceful, and calm, as if I was finally ready to meet them.\n\nWhat This Means for Me: \n\nThis wasn’t just a strange dream, it was a contact event. One I now feel was meant for me, timed precisely with cosmic conditions, and received because I was in full alignment. The state I was in, aware, grounded, but unable to manipulate the dream, wasn’t disempowering. It was intentional. I was placed into the experience with full presence, but not control, because this wasn’t about imagination, it was about witnessing.\n\nI believe I’m a bridge. Between dimensions. Between realms. Between consciousnesses. These beings didn’t appear to frighten or confuse me, they arrived in a form tailored for my awareness, and I accepted them with curiosity, calm, and peace. That says something, not just about them, but about my role.\n\nI’ve felt this growing inside me for a while now. A calling. I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I know this is just the beginning. These beings, this contact, this path, it’s leading somewhere. And I’ll keep walking it with openness, clarity, and a deep sense of purpose. If they are watching, guiding, or waiting, I’m here. Aligned. Ready.\n\nIf anyone else has encountered beings like this or felt their contact come through dream or altered states, I’d love to hear from you. And if not, maybe this image and story will trigger a memory in you, or open a new doorway you’ve been preparing to walk through.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\n",

My siblings and I have a good relationship with our mom, which is why this dream was so terrifying.\n\nAnyway, here’s the dream: I can’t remember how it started, but I just remember running away from my mom in our home—like she was possessed by something. I tried going to our neighbors' houses to hide, but somehow, my mom would act nice and worried, saying, *\"Have you seen my daughter? I'm worried sick.\"* My neighbors would hesitantly give me back to her or tell her where I was.\n\nNo matter where I hid, it always ended the same way—being returned to my \"worried\" mom. Eventually, I found myself hiding in a house belonging to someone new in the neighborhood, someone we had no significant relationship with. I was able to stay hidden there for quite some time. The person sheltering me was kind and genuinely concerned for me.\n\nHowever, as a child who believed in the goodness of her mom, I thought she had \"changed.\" I saw her searching for me through a window, and somehow, the aura around her seemed lighter, almost as if she had returned to normal. Thinking she was back to her true self, I ran to her and hugged her.\n\nBut that relief vanished the moment she suddenly wrapped her hands around my neck and started strangling me. It was the evil version of my mom.\n\nSuddenly, everything sped up. The perspective of my dream shifted—I was now watching myself from a third-person point of view, seeing my own body being strangled by my mom. Then, the neighbors appeared, their faces twisted into eerie smiles, their eyes bloodshot.\n\nMy mom was trying to put something on me, holding scissors as she began cutting my body, molding it into something else. Just as the nightmare reached its peak, I woke up to my girlfriend calling me.\n\nI can't think of any particular reason why I dreamt of this. I wasn’t even thinking about anything scary. But sometimes, I do get random horror dreams, and strangely, whenever something bad happens to me in a dream, it feels like my body and spirit separate. My body experiences the suffering, while my spirit watches from a third-person perspective—until I finally wake up.  Does anyone experience this dissociative phenomenon whenever they dream?",

It’s still the only dream I’ve had of him in the fourteen years since.\n\nWhen it begins, I’m asleep in my bed, the same bed I was actually sleeping in. I wake up to the sound of someone in the nearby kitchen. I get up and go into the kitchen where I see that someone has put a casserole in the oven. It’s one of my dad’s favorite dishes. I look into the adjoining living room and see dad sitting in his chair.\n\nI know in the dream that this is strange, but it’s more confusing than unsettling. When I walk into the living room, dad sees me and says, “Did I wake you up? Sorry, I haven’t had much of an appetite lately but now I’m hungry as hell.” \n\nI tell him that it’s okay and that it smells good. He says the only problem is that we’re out of cheese to sprinkle on top, and asks if I’d mind running out to the store with him.\n\nThen we’re in his truck. He’s driving and I’m in the passenger seat looking at him, still trying to make sense of it. He notices me looking at him strangely and asks what’s wrong. It takes me a moment to figure out how to respond. “Pop,” I say at last. “Do you remember what happened?”\n\nHe thinks for a minute and then gets a somewhat sad look on his face. “Yeah. Yeah, that’s right,” he says. “I died, didn’t I?”\n\n“Yes,” I answer. “You did.”\n\nDad looks pensive and nods slowly as if coming to accept that truth. And then he turns to me with a smile and says, “Well then, maybe YOU should be driving!”\n\nI laughed in the dream and when I woke up immediately after I was actually laughing!\n\nAnd the thing is- that’s exactly what my dad would have said. That was his sense of humor to a tee! Not mine. Now I don’t know if that was a visit from his spirit, or if it was my own subconscious trying to send me what I would consider to be a pretty obvious message! \n\nI find both explanations to be deeply comforting.",

    "title": "Dreamt about my ex from 11 years ago and it's making me feel some type of way",
    "content": "I'm so glad I found this sub because I just want to get this off my chest. And this is going to be a rant.\n\nYesterday morning I (f28) had a dream about my ex boyfriend from 11 years ago... Again! I would say it happens like once a year. And I've been in a happy relationship with the another guy for 9 years and that's what disturbs me about it really.\n\nA little backstory, I (f28) was with my ex for 3 years, from 14-17 years of age and he was my first love, he was 2 years older then me. We had a very strong and fun relationship through it all in just our own little world but the last year was pretty awful because he was messaging other girls (\"friends\") and keeping secrets from me about who he was hanging out with etc., breaking my little heart since he was literally my EVERYTHING, and when it was just us living our lives it felt like I was his as well. I ended things with him eventually because my feelings cooled of when he was being so toxic towards me and a story as old as time he got obsessed and wanted me back like a month after, got worried about who I was talking to etc. We continued for a little bit just as friends with benefits kinda, and kinda trying to get back together, but I soon broke it of for good because it was not good for either of us. I needed to let him go, I never got my strong feelings back, and he needed to \"decool\" from me. So we did, haven't spoken in 11 years accept for one time when he was writing about how depressed he was on Instagram and was making subtle hints about maybe ending his life because we broke up, like a few months after our last breakup. His family took over after that and then we never talked again.\n\nToday I'm with my now boyfriend, that I've been in a relationship with for 9 years, in a very stabile and loving relationship and he is my rock and my comfort and I am his, we have a child together and plan our features together. But I cant stop dreaming about my ex boyfriends from time to time, like once a year maybe. My only ex boyfriend, as well. And I feel bad because I know that I was obsessed with this guy back in the days when we were a couple, more obsessed than I am with my now boyfriend. But I guess like obsessed like a teenager can be, not very mature or healthy which my love for my now boyfriend is. But I I get this awful feeling you get when you dream about some people (or at least I think others can relate... haha), that the feeling you have in your dreams continue with you through the day and when I dream about him I literally become a little bit obsessed with him again. It's crazy I feel like. This mornings dream was about him and I messaging as adults and meeting up in his car that he had back then, and he put his hand on my lap and I almost started lucid dreaming I think because I could actually feel the sensation of his hand, like I was holding it and I have never experiences that before and it felt so nice. Then I woke up, obsessed? And feeling like an asshole.\n\nI never think of him through out the years normally, I Never even see him out in town but all of my family has seen him since. It's so freaking weird. I just live my life with my family and then BAM like once a year I dream of him and I become obsessed with him for like a day, wanting to get closure (with closure I mean ask him if he ever did love me as much as I loved him, or did actually cheat on me, or why he did all that stuff in the end and yadda yadda) because for some reason after my dreams I feel like i need that \"closure\" to know if that relationship was as real as I think of it, and kinda me wanting him to clarify that it was as real and such a big and \"meaningful\" first love as I think of it. I understand that it maybe sounds crazy from a grown woman and I get that but it's almost like a chemical reaction whenever he pops up in my dreams. To clarify I have never reached out to him or anything because I know it's just something I'm thinking about because I've dreamt of him, he is nothing that actually, normally, keeps me up at night.\n\nI don't know what my point is with this post besides me getting it off my chest, and maybe seeing if someone can relate? Am I crazy? Or whatever your thoughts are. Is this a phenomenon I have never heard of? Thank you if you read it all, and don't judge me to hard, please.",

Mostly curious what people think it might mean and my friend encouraged me to post it, so here goes:\n\nMy entire vision is filled with white and the rest of the dream is in flashes of black and white. I know the dream starts in first person perspective, but I cannot move to see my body. Far away and across from me, there is another version of me similarly stuck in place, mainly in black but with some greys etc. The only action other me can take is to roll a scribbly, dense ball forwards. 'Original' me knows I need to move out of the way, but I'm stuck. The camera shifts rapidly between the original first person perspective and another far enough away to see both of the mes. The ball rolls towards me faster and larger until I can only see static. I feel the impact of the boulder crushing me. I die. I switch to the other 'me' who rolled the boulder, and the dream repeats like this, with the ball getting larger and faster each time.\n\nAt some point, I wake up. I always have a migraine from the flashing static-y colors. Sometimes that is it for the night, and sometimes whenever I fall back asleep again it continues. I usually don't remember my dreams but I remember this one vividly, and every time I enter into it I know immediately it's Tumbleweed TimeTM.\n\nWhat's weird about this dream thinking back on it is that it seems very video game/horror game inspired; and yet when they started, I was a kid who hadn't consumed either of those yet in any capacity. I kinda wish I can have it again to recount it in more detail, but I do remember being panicked AF every time I woke up from it so xD\n\nCurious if anyone can offer any insight, scientific or otherwise?

Unfortunately things went far, but I didn't really want it that much, I kind of just got into freeze mode and knew it wasn't right. He was wearing protection, but at some point I got scared that it broke so I took a Plan B just in case.\n\nIt is something I felt guilty/regret about for years and had such a hard time telling my current boyfriend. Thankfully, he was understanding about it and I'm now with him. He's in a different country and we've been together for over half a year.\n\nI've noticed that every night that my boyfriend and I have been intimate through the phone let's just say, I keep having these uncomfortable dreams that I'm with my ex and there's some of his liquids went inside of me and that I'd have to take a Plan B, but I was scared to take a Plan B. There's always something of being afraid of getting pregnant in my dreams and also being afraid to tell my boyfriend and fears that he thinks that I cheated on him. The dream I had last night I was questioning if my ex drugged me.\n\nI have these dreams quite often now and I'm not sure why. I'm going to meet my boyfriend in person next month and we're not going to be that intimate because I don't feel comfortable with just protection and I don't feel comfortable taking Plan B due to some ingredients. When we are in the same country and I can get an IUD then it will be different. This is with or without the dreams.\n\nI've become used to these dreams so when they happen, I'm not that scared just a bit bothered, I just know that it's a dream now. But when I used to have them, I'd wake up really uncomfortable.\n\nI'm not sure if this is some sort of a warning or just reliving 'trauma'",

My curiosity got the best of me and I begged a friend to take me there.\n\nIts a steep climb up, but in this scenario my friend was a pilot and flew a helicopter in. You can tell when you arrive by the strong winds that create a barrier between Wind Island and the rest of the mountain. The tall trees also grew sideways from the wind constantly blowing one direction. The path is a grassy curve into an desolate arena. There's some people there sitting on rocks and logs and a swingset.\n\nThe thing about Wind Island, which I had forgotten until I got there, is there's monsters. They rotate; I remember seeing a new one each time I went (I don't remember the previous monsters). And you always sat somewhere high, whether it be the rocks or the logs or the swingset, because if you touch the ground in Wind Island the monster will attack and kill you in a gruesome and torturous manner.\n\nThis monster looked like a large horse. It was fast, and it got a hold of my leg and almost dragged me off a log, but I managed to escape. It didn't bug me after that. Instead, it focused on something else.\n\nTW death and rotting\n\n>!The swingset had a baby swing, and in that was a baby boy. He was stiff with his blue eyes open, and I realized he had been dead a while. My only thought was one of the popular kids brought their baby brother up, and didn't take good enough care of him, and the monster got him. Clutched in his fist was a stuffed horse. Maybe he saw the horse monster and thought he could trust it. The horse monster went behind him and was feasting on his back, which was eaten away to reveal all his innards.!<\n\nAfter that I promptly left with my friend in the helicopter, and shortly after that I woke up.\n\nLike I said I've been here before, but never was it to the extent of that horror. It's usually me vs the monster, not me seeing the monster had already gotten a victim.

I guess this jolted me awake and I could feel the tingle on my face when I woke up! After processing for a minute or two, I went to look in the mirror and my face was flushed. This dream in particular, even though I had always had very vivid, sometimes lucid dreams made me start paying attention to my dreamworld in a little bit greater detail I just couldn’t Understand how I could physically feel something that happened in a dream and have evidence on my face Even after waking up.\n\nThe next time it happened was a few years later. Last year to be exact I was up all night cleaning getting ready to move.And I had a very vivid flash dream as I fell asleep folding these clothes, I traveled somewhere in the desert and had three men that looked to be African or Moorishbased off their attire that resembled. They were standing in front of me one in the front, two in the back one in the front wearing gold dashiki with a matching hat that had two crescent moons facing opposite of each other and a star or a son in the middle of the two moons.The man on the left wore the purple dashiki of the same style and same logo on the front of his hat, and the one on the RighTS was green. I have never seen these men a day in my life, but the front man hugged me so caringly and whispered in my ear while giving me a hug. he said something in a foreign language along the lines of  “son fun won gee” …. He then kissed meon the right side of my forehead. Then he whispered “remember child“. I then snapped awake.And rushed to a notebook to write down exactly what he had said because as I didn’t recognize this man, all I felt was pure love. As if he was a grandfather type figure. Which is a little wild to me, considering I am very much Caucasian, but I am in a mixed relationship. A month had passed and my kids kept telling me I had a heart on my forehead. They are seven and eight and I did not know what the hell they were talking about. I continuously brush them off, not understanding what it meant. I seriously thought they were talking about the shape of my eyebrows or maybe my 11 lines on my forehead. I had no clue. Then one day I noticed in the mirror that I had a heart on my forehead, right where that man had kissed and it looks like I’ve lost all the pigmentation just in that spot and it’s a perfect heart.\n\n",

Sometimes, the dreams would have something running around the house trying to peek at me through each window no matter where I tried to hide, or there would be something huge or far away that could see me when I go past a certain window. I would have to search for blind spots to avoid it, but an event would occur that would prevent me from staying in that spot. Or I'd try to close the windows but every time i tried to block them with a curtain or blanket, it felt as if there was always a crack that allowed whatever was out there to look in.\n\nWhen I was around 12-14, I used to be afraid of looking outside at night due to a supersition from my culture. I would behave the same way I did in my dreams because of my paranoia. I was so terrified, I'd run out of my room if I heard a single tap on my window. I'd even wake up in the middle of the night to audio hallucinations of something slowly tapping on the walls until it would eventually get to my window. My guess is it could be a reflection of my childhood fear.",

    "title": "does anyone know what this might mean? prophesy-like dream",
    "content": "ive always known the universe or gods speak to me in my dreams, but this was the most clear out of any other dream ive had. i was visiting my friend who lives in georgia and during this time period i was experimenting with spirituality, specifically christianity. one night me and my friend went to bed and i had the weirdest dream. i was in my hometown in brasil which is a common setting in a lot of my dreams but something was different. i looked to the sky and i saw this giant blood red moon and i pointed at it and i screamed “HADES!” as if i was like a superhero who was going to save the world or something. then the dream cut to this other part where i was sort of on a set of stairs or by it at least and i saw 4 horses, black white red and like a pale-ish color. and near them was this person with a violin and another with a trumpet. after i woke up i immediately told my friend because i thought it was funny, who screams “HADES” at the moon like what?!? it did in fact become an inside joke. ANYWAY, the week passes and sunday comes. Me and my friend decided we were going to go to church together. We got to church mid worship kind of and just waited until the pastor came on the stage to speak. i zoned out for a little bit but when i “zoned back in,” they were talking about the book of revelation. mind you i have NEVER in my life read revelation, the farthest i’ve gotten in the bible was the book of mark and i haven’t finished. i did know though, that revelation was about like the prophecies and stuff so i was intrigued. then the freaky part, the pastor started reading verses, and it was exactly the same as my dream. hades, the four horsemen, the blood red moon. i sat there in shock because what the fuck do you mean?!? me and my friend just looked at each other in awe because it was so insane. after that we kind of debriefed what happened in the car. now almost one year later we still mention it from time to time because it was so crazy. im not a christian but i believe a little bit of everything, so this freaked me the fuck out. i tried asking the people at the church i used to go to for answers but they did nothing to help me. i stopped going to church a couple of months ago because it didn’t feel right, but the search for answers about what this dream means continues. this story sounds literally psychotic but i promise you its real. if any of you know what this might mean or have experienced something different please feel free to reply :)",

    "title": "The mysterious island",
    "content": "I recently had a dream about a mysterious island. It seemed like i knew about it in my dream as if i heard about it previously amd i had been searching for it for a long time. I dont remember but there was someone along with me who was also searching for it. The description about the island was that there is a ship(A huge Ship) which is always parked next to it and it is only visible at certain times. In search for it i was on the beach where it is visible from around post sunset. There was a shipwreck in the vicinity due to various adventurere probably searching for the island. In the dream i started with getting a boat and going towards the location of island but the waves were trapping me to come back to shore. I couldn't see the island but according to storied i think i knew the general location or something. I went to the ocean towards the island but kept coming back to shore like some glitch. I saw some other guy or a pair who where helping me or maybe wanted to join me as i repeatedly washed up to the shore. After trying for sometime we got hungry and went to eat something from a street vendor. As soon as i turned to look at the ocean i saw the island with a huge ship and palm trees and very eerie presence. I asked the vendor do you see the ship by turning towards him and he said something i couldnt register. I looked back again at the ocean but the whole ocean was evaporated. No sign of water. It was a dessert in place of the ocean. Again i turned back to the vendor asking about the situation. He said that the land absorbes the water or something. Once i started looking closely. I saw a huge face in the sky made of black shadow looking for something on the beach. I quickly hid but i think it saw us group. The shadow came towrds us and grabbed the person who was trying to help me. The guy got unconscious and the shadow pulled him towards the island.  Next the shadow wanted me i guess but as soon as it moved i woke up. \n\nJust a iteration of a weird dream i guess.",

    "content": "So I don’t usually get lucid dreams, but when I do, they’re absolutely ridiculous. This one starts off normal enough—I’m at home, stressed out, trying to finish something overdue (probably something I’ve been avoiding IRL). Everything feels off, though, like that weird dream logic where you know something isn’t right.\n\nThen—out of nowhere—Beelzemon, as in the gun-slinging, demon-biker Digimon himself, busts through my freaking wall like a boss fight I wasn’t prepared for. Dude has his twin shotguns locked on me, and I instantly know I’m screwed.\n\nBut then it clicks—I’m dreaming.\n\nAnd if I’m dreaming? That means… I can fight back.\n\nSo, naturally, I go full \"Mr. Anderson\" mode. My clothes shift into the classic all-black trench coat, sunglasses just appear on my face, and suddenly, I’m Neo. Beelzemon starts firing, but I do the Matrix bullet dodge, tilting back in that slow-motion way where I can see the shells zoom past me. I should be scared, but at this point, I’m just hyped.\n\nWe start throwing hands—him, teleporting and unloading shotgun rounds, me, stopping bullets mid-air and countering with some reality-breaking kicks. It’s actually one of the coolest dream fights I’ve ever had. We’re smashing through walls, fighting in the sky, full anime battle-style… and then—\n\nFor some reason—we both just stop.\n\nAnd the next thing I know, we’re at Target.\n\nLike, straight-up, middle-of-the-aisles Target, just casually walking together. I have no idea how or why, but it’s like the fight never happened. Beelzemon is just chilling, browsing through snacks like this is totally normal. Meanwhile, I’m standing there in full Neo mode, wondering what the hell just happened.\n\nThen I woke up.\n\n",
