    "title": "A dream I call \"The Hound\"",
    "content": "They there! dream story time. So that's a rendition I never actually finished of how I looked like in this particular dream. It was set in a world or place where medieval/feudal aspecta mixed with futuristic ones, specially science wise.\n\nThere, a sketchy lord had captured both my best friend and I, wanting to keep her as his wife agaisnt her wishes. The fate he decided for me was to be the one to help him keep her captive, by modifying me biologically.\n\nYou see, that lord in the dream, ran a business by controlling people's minds and will via chemicals or implants and in my case, he inyected me something daily that made me forget who I was, forget about my friend, and kind of be in factory settings convinced that I had always been with him as part of his bodyguard and his \"hound\" with enhanced physical skills and ability to track people down, more specifically my friend. I had an unbearable instict to find her whenever she tried to escape, that was my job and I was 100% it had always been that way. \n\nUnder his command, I kept my friend from escaping his manor multiple tiems and she of course begged me to remember her  and help her. At some point idk how I managed to override that Jekyll & hyde situation within myself and came back to my senses. I apologized profusely for everything I had done while I was not myself and helped her get away together. \n\nWe were chased by the lord's guards and where they seemed too close for both of us to make it, i told her to keep going while I bought time. I waited and tried to fight them off but I was thwon to the ground and held there. When I was pinned down, some people in white lab coats stabbled a needle on my neck. It hurt like hell and I knew I was being \"transformed\" again into the hound. I was just hoping that my friend had gotten away and was passing out until I woke up in real life.",
