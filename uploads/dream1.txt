It’s been years since I’ve had this dream, but it still affects me to this day so I want to share about it here.

I’m Italian, so please excuse any mistakes. 🙏

So, at the beginning of the dream I was a middle-aged man, living in an arabic country (can’t say with certainty which one) with my wife and daughter. A war erupted, and for some reasons we were accused as guilty, so we had to hide or they would execute us publicly. As a father, I decided to stay behind to make sure my wife and daughter could escape freely, checking the streets before them. At this point we split up, and I pass from being the father to being the daughter: I’m gonna say I was about 9/10 years old, I wore a hijab, and I remember seeing myself in the mirror and thinking “My father is still with me, I have his eyes” and smiling because when I smiled I really resembled him. So it was now me and my mom, running and hiding. We were hiding everywhere we could, it was really really scary — but, one day, we found a bakery. We sat outside, and we were rambling about the things we wanted to eat, I remember saying “In my next life, I’ll have bread, and I’ll have breakfast everyday” and we saw a glimpse of the baker inside, but he smiled at us, so we kept on talking about food hoping he could offer us some… but what we didn’t expect was the police arriving. The baker still smiling. Here, I realise he was not smiling for mercy, but because he found us and could report us. The police arrives, and we are taken to a plaza for our public execution. As they shot us, I could only think about the breakfast I would’ve wanted. Then I died, and I saw the universe, and I was reborn as myself.

Needless to say, I had the biggest breakfast of my life after I woke up.
